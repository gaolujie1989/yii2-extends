If you're accessing the API directly, authentication is required, and you'll need to obtain an access token. However, if you're authorizing a service provider, you'll need to install and authorize a service provider app within your OTTO account.\n\nAuthentication methods vary depending on your approach. Below, you'll find a brief introduction to the different authentication options for accessing the various API endpoints tailored to these scenarios.\n\n### Accessing the API on My Own Behalf as a Seller (Partner)\n\nIf you have your own IT department capable of developing interfaces for the OTTO Market API, you can create self-apps in the OTTO Partner Connect (OPC) portal and obtain a client ID and client secret for authentication via the client credential flow. This flow should be used by all OTTO Market Partners when establishing a connection with the API hosted by their organization. Refer to the following section for detailed information on creating self-apps and using the client credential flow.\n\n#### Steps to Access API as an OTTO Market Partner using self-apps with the client credential flow\n\nAs an OTTO Partner, follow these steps to leverage the OTTO Market API:\n\n1. Log in to [OTTO Partner Connect (OPC)](https://portal.otto.market/) portal.\n2. If necessary, please assign yourself the user right “API-Zugriff” in the [user administration](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Nutzerverwaltung) and log in again so that the API access is authorized.\n3. Navigate to the [API access (\"API-Zugriff\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/API) section, where you'll find Sandbox and Live environments.\n4. Choose the environment where you want to create an app and click \"Neue App erstellen\" to proceed.\n5. Provide a name for your app and select at least one scope that your app will need access to. Click \"App erstellen\" to proceed.\n6. Your app has been successfully created, and you'll be redirected to the credentials tab.\n\n**Note:**\n- There's a limit to the number of apps you can create. If you reach this limit, you must delete an old one before creating a new one.\n- The client secret for the app is displayed only once. If you miss or forget it, you'll need to rotate the client secret.\n\n**Access Token Generation:**\n\nImplement the Client Credentials Flow to generate an access token, granting you access to the OTTO Market API.\n\n- The Host header should be either `sandbox.api.otto.market` or `api.otto.market`.\n- The request body should be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\nExample cURL command:\n```bash\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url 'https://api.otto.market/v1/token' \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  --data grant_type=client_credentials \\\n  --data client_id={CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --data client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  --data 'scope=orders products'\n```\n\nIf your request is **successful**, the API server responds with an **access token** in a JSON object that looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiISNCXIgiLCJSZWNla[...omitted for brevity...]\",\n  \"expires_in\": 1800,\n  \"refresh_expires_in\": 0,\n  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n  \"not-before-policy\": 1666271301,\n  \"scope\": \"orders products\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: Please bear in mind that there is no refresh token when obtaining an access token using the client credential grant type. The client needs to use its credentials, i.e., client ID and client secret, to obtain a new token once the access token has expired or is about to expire.\n<br/>\n\n### [Deprecated] Accessing the API on My Own Behalf as a Seller (Partner)\n**Note**: Using this outdated approach to access the OTTO market API is discouraged, and it is advised to avoid its use. This option is going to be sunset in the future, so you should not use it for new development. If you are already using this approach, you should migrate to the new flow. The preferred method is [Accessing the API on My Own Behalf as a Seller (Partner)](#accessing-the-api-on-my-own-behalf-as-a-seller-partner).\n\n#### Fetching an Access Token\nTo access the Otto Market API, you need to authenticate your API user account and obtain an access token. This section describes how to obtain an access token using the password grant type.\n\n#### Requesting an Access Token\nTo request an access token, send a POST request to the /token endpoint of the Otto Market API with the following parameters:\n\n* <b>username</b>: Your API user account username.\n* <b>password</b>: Your API user account password. Make sure to URL-encode any special characters.\n* <b>grant_type</b>: Set to \"password\" to indicate that you're using the password grant type to obtain an access token.\n* <b>client_id</b>: Identifies your application to the API. Set to \"token-otto-api\".\n\nFor example, you can use the following cURL command to retrieve your access token:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\nhttps://api.otto.market/v1/token \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\\n-d 'username=<YourUsername>&password=<YourPassword>&grant_type=password&client_id=token-otto-api'\n```\n\nNote that you need to include your own username and password in the cURL command and URL-encode any special characters. For example, if your password is \"my!@password\", you would include it in the command above as \"my%21%40password\".\n\nAlternatively, you can let cURL encode the POST data by using --data-urlencode instead:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\\n  --data-urlencode username=<YourUsername> \\\n  --data-urlencode password=<YourPassword> \\\n  --data-urlencode grant_type=password \\\n  --data-urlencode client_id=token-otto-api\n\n```\n#### Response\n\nIf your request is successful, the API server responds with an access token in a JSON object that looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiISNCXIgiLCJSZWNla[...omitted for brevity...]\",\n  \"expires_in\": 1800,\n  \"refresh_expires_in\": 7200,\n  \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOO[...omitted for brevity...]\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"not-before-policy\": 0,\n  \"session_state\": \"3e0710b2-b57a-4cb0-a51d-6de60a997356\",\n  \"scope\": \"pumba-roles-app-portal partner email profile\"\n}\n```\n\nThe <b>\"access_token\"</b> property contains the access token that you can use to authenticate subsequent requests to the Otto Market API. Make sure to include the access token in the Authorization header of your API requests, using the Bearer token type.\n\n\n#### Example\nHere's an example cURL command that retrieves a list of products from the Otto Market API, using the access token obtained in the previous step:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\\nhttps://api.otto.market/v2/products \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' \\\n-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache'\n```\nThis cURL command sends a GET request to the /v2/products endpoint of the Otto Market API, with the Authorization header set to the access token obtained in the previous step. The -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' option is included to ensure that the server doesn't return a cached response.\n\n#### Best-practice when renewing a token\n\nUse available tokens as long as possible before fetching a new `access_token`. In general new access_tokens should be fetched by using\nthe `refresh_token`. Expiration date of an access token is indicated by the attribute `expires_in` for access_tokens\nand `refresh_expires_in` for refresh_tokens. Please bear in mind that a refresh token can only be used once.\nIn other words, once a refresh token is used to obtain a new access token, then the same refresh token cannot be reused even if it has not yet expired.\n\n\n#### Use refresh token\nA single refresh token can only be used to obtain a new access token, if\n\n1) The refresh token has not expired, and\n2) The refresh token has not been used before.\n\nThe refresh token can be extracted from the <code\nclass=\"inline\">refresh_token</code> value.\nOnce the access token has expired or is going to be expired, you should use the refresh token to get a new\naccess token, without using your users credentials again. You can use the\nfollowing cURL command. Include the refresh token (without leading and trailing < >).\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\\n  -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>&grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=token-otto-api'\n```\n\nThe response of this request will look like the example above, the access token\ncan be extracted from <code class=\"inline\">access_token</code> and the new\nrefresh token from <code class=\"inline\">refresh_token</code>.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Accessing the API as a Service Provider on Behalf of a Seller (Partner)\n\n#### Installing and Authorizing OTTO Market Apps as a Seller (Partner)\n\nFor OTTO Market Partners needing to install and authorize OTTO Market apps created by service providers, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to [OTTO Partner Connect (OPC)](https://portal.otto.market) portal.\n2. Click on the link provided by the Service Provider or visit their homepage.\n3. Grant consent for the app to access the specified scopes displayed in the consent screen. Failure to grant consent will prevent app installation and access to your data.\n\n**Note:**\nAll specified scopes must be granted access; partial access is not permitted.\n4. Once consent is granted, the app is installed and can be used. It will also be displayed in the \"Installed Apps\" tab on the [service provider page (\"Dienstleister\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Dienstleister).\n\n#### Revoke Consent\n\nTo revoke consent, navigate to the overview of your installed apps on the [service provider page (\"Dienstleister\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Dienstleister). Hover over the app name and click \"Zugriff entziehen\" to confirm revocation.\nUninstalling the app revokes its access to your data. Of course, you can re-install the app if you want to.\n\n<br /> \n\n### Creating and Authorizing OTTO Market Apps as a Service Provider\n\nFor information on creating and authorizing OTTO Market apps as a service provider, refer to the [Developer Program](/docs#section/Developer-Program) section.\n\n## Scopes\n\nScopes corresponds to [OAuth scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/). They are used for providing fine-grained access control to the OTTO Market APIs. Scopes need to be used via the authorization in the client credential flow or the authorization code flow. \n\n### Scopes for OTTO Market APIs\nThe below table gives mapping of displayed scope names in UI to the scope names to be used for fetching token\n\n| Display Name      | Scope Name (To be used in fetching token) |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Products          | products                                  |\n| Orders            | orders                                    |\n| Receipts          | receipts                                  |\n| Returns           | returns                                   |\n| Price Reduction   | price-reduction                           |\n| Shipments         | shipments                                 |\n| Quantities        | quantities                                |\n| Shipping Profiles | shipping-profiles                         |\n| Availability\t    | availability                              |\n\n### Content declaration of available scopes\n\n#### Products\n\nThe product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4).\n\n#### Quantities - depcrecated and will be shut down to the end of March 25. Use the Availability Interface for updating quantities.\n\nOnce the products have been successfully transmitted using the products scope, only the quantities are missing to make the products available to the end customer on otto.de. For this purpose the Quantity Interface allows partners and service providers to update the available quantity for a specific SKU.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Quantities-V2).\n\n#### Shipping Profiles\n\nWith this interface you can create, change and manage shipping profiles of the otto market partners. \n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/ShippingProfiles-V1).\n\n#### Availability\n\nOnce the products have been successfully transmitted using the products scope, your need to send quantities to make the products available to the end customer on otto.de. \nAs well you need to connect the sku to existing shipping profiles for the delivery information. \nFor this purpose the Availability Interface allows partners and service providers to update necessary information to make a SKU available on otto.de.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Availability-V1).\n\n#### Orders\n\nThis interface allows partners and service providers to view orders and associated position items. It also allows to send cancellations on order and position item level.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4).\n\n#### Shipments\n\nThis interface should be used to report that shipments have been handed over to the carrier for final delivery to the customer. You can also get access to Return-Shipments for retrieving track and trace data for returns from the customer to the partner warehouse.\n\nShipments - Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1).\nReturn-Shipments - Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/ReturnShipments-V1).\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis scope enables the user to manage returns. This includes retrieving a list of announced returns, accepting and declining returns.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V3).\n\n#### Receipts\n\nOTTO Market provides receipts to the customers to document financial processes. The scopes enables users to download these documents as a PDF or a JSON.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V2).\n\n#### Price Reduction\n\nThis endpoint enables sellers to apply price reductions to shipped products if the customer is unsatisfied and asks for a partial refund instead of returning the product completely.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Price-Reductions-V1).\n\n\n## Calling an Endpoint\nAll endpoints are secured via authorization. You add the HTTP <code class=\"inline\">Authorization</code>\n-Header with value <code class=\"inline\">Bearer ey...</code> and will get access.\n```\ncurl -X GET \\\n  https://api.otto.market/v2/orders \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5jdhstdheSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICI4T1d6MjhuZ01GbHBURDl5TGtxQkRHMThuYXZNVFgyTWtqNVhkY0RITDBZIn0.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.SleUexNdapaY5RmrVTbKRMiVpRrbNLjIUi7fILsW1hkpqQbX4IQRaSufSt98Ar0OkEmIvZvYPpGVecmjwYvD3YQzBmlcdU0V544Y0h8y01RyxZAYGZbRXfA1kOsFDucnrClCcj1JIaQMU4629wU9OM_SdQaLvfTA2l5prma94RekdWR3S-6DzXqJDtHrrcYS8BsfohkuLdi1U8vPUjwee9lsY3RTa9YZVekH4hFVWMl0Pbwub8jwum6zRjTu-ZAiLhZSnl8mSaMtrJFmkzRi3-s9eN7k0lnLKWGt7JuqZ_vbiJT8ZhHvPur4eLrY02ehF6-lwSUyjWMCzCi5TjBgYg'\n```\n\nThe expected result has an HTTP 200 code with a probably empty list.\n\n## Rate Limiting\nA high volume of calls on API services at any given time would increase server resource consumption. If the load is due to an unauthorized intrusion it would be a chaos. Thus, rate limiting becomes extremely important.\n\nIn general authenticated API calls are limited for each partner to 20 requests per second.\nExceeding the rate limit results in a HTTP 429 \"too many requests\" error.\nFor some endpoints the rate limit is lower to ensure the best quality for all API users. Please see below:\n\n|Endpoint path|HTTP method|Max requests per time unit|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|/products|GET|10 per second|\n|/products|POST|20 per second|\n|/products/active-status|GET|10 per second|\n|/products/active-status|POST|3600 per day|\n|/products/marketplace-status|GET|10 per second|\n|/products/categories|GET|10 per second|\n|/products/brands|GET|10 per second|\n|/v1/token|POST|10 per second for each IP|\n|other endpoints|POST & GET|20 per second|\n\n### User Based API Throttling\nA general method of limiting usage of API resource is to allocate a pre-configured static or dynamic quota for a consumer. The API rate limiting is done on the basis of partner-id. A particular partner-id can make 20 requests per second.\n\n### Best Practice\nPlease divide your requests over the day and avoid sending all data at once. Make use of the individual limits for the interfaces. This helps preventing our systems from clogging and ensures a flawless experience for everyone.\n\n## Timeouts and Defaults\n| Name            | Value | Description                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| request timeout | 10s   | The maximum HTTP request timeout for all interfaces                                                             |\n| limit           | 128   | The default for limit query parameter. See Paging. The default limit can be overwritten in specific interfaces. |\n\n## Common Patterns\n### Interface Definition\nOur REST interface definitions are basically using swagger.io.\nAll interface definitions can be automatically used by you to generate necessary API objects and similar in\nyour chosen implementation language.\nIn order to remain technically extensible and up-to-date, individual interfaces may have been\ndescribed in new or different definition schemes. We are constantly trying to keep all interfaces\ntechnically up to date.\n\n### Versioning\nThe OTTO Market API uses different versions for the single endpoints. The version number is included in the URL path.\n[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme is used, but only the major version. Breaking changes are only introduced in new major versions. API version is required in all urls.\n\nEndpoints may introduce new optional fields at any time in the request and any new fields in the response. The client must skip all unknown fields.\n\nFor every endpoint, a changelog exists which displays the latest released changes and the upcoming unreleased changes. Additionally, an overall [Changelog](/) exists with the most exciting changes about the API in general.\n\n### Supporting old versions\nThe OTTO Partner API continues to support old versions of an API for **6 months** from the time of public announcement for the new version of a given API.\nIt is recommanded to check regularly. This can be be automated by checking HTTP headers for the attribute `SunsetHeader`, which indicates when versions go offline.\n\n#### Best-practice\nRegurlarly check for the `SunsetHeader` and act as soon as the attribute appears by updating your integration to the new version within the presented time frame.\n\n__example:__\n```\nWarning: v2 is deprecated. Please migrate to v3\nSunset: Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT\nDeprecation: Wed, 11 Nov 2018 23:59:59 GMT\nLink: <https://api.otto.market/v3/orders>; rel=\"successor-version\"\n```\n\n## Header\nSome common headers should be set by clients:\n\n1. Set the <code class=\"inline\">X-Request-Timestamp</code> header according to the [ISO-8601](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) standard. You can use this regex pattern: <code class=\"inline\">^\\d{4}-(0\\d|1[0-2])-([0-2]\\d|3[01])T(2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d:[0-5]\\d(\\.\\d+)?(\\[+-](2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d|Z)$</code>\n2. Set <code class=\"inline\">Accept</code> to the desired response format e.g. <code class=\"inline\">application/json</code>\n3. Set the <code class=\"inline\">Content-Type</code> header to define the used format in the request body, only applicable if you send a request body\n\n## HTTP Methods\nThe interfaces describe which HTTP methods are allowed and how to use them.\nOur basic concern is that basically all HTTP Methods are allowed in the [standardized way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).\nNote that these methods should behave as specified by their\n[standardized meaning (idempotency)](http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/idempotency/).\nThe following is a description of a few special features, relevant facts or ways to use some of the HTTP methods.\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand for details</summary>\n\n### POST\nPOST will update specific fields **and** returns the result like a GET would do (error response is independent).\n\n### PUT\nPUT will create or replace the whole entity independent of an existing entity.\n\n### PATCH\nPATCH will update specific fields **and** not return data like a GET would do (error response is independent).\nPATCH body is structured in the same way as PUT and POST (entity body).\nAll fields added into your body will be updated, other fields will not be affected.\n\n__example:__\n```\n{\n  \"username\" : \"myusername\",\n  \"email\" : null\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\nWe are using [standardized HTTP status code](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)\nwith a body only if needed (it also just can be empty), but details about that you can find at the\nconcrete interface implementation.\n\n| Verb   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| HEAD   | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| GET    | Used for retrieving resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| POST   | Used for creating resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| PATCH  | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data.

For PUT requests with no body attribute, be sure to set the Content-Length header to zero.                                                                                                                                                                |\n| DELETE | Used for deleting resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## Error Message Style\nError messages are returned as content type \"application/json;charset=utf-8\" in the following format:\n```\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/orders/1000331\",\n      \"title\":  \"Invalid Attribute\",\n      \"code\": \"490\",\n      \"detail\": \"First name must contain at least three characters.\",\n      \"detail-structured\": {...},\n      \"jsonpath\": \"[@.orderid=='12345']/invoiceAddress/firstname\",\n      \"logref\": \"key to find in the log\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"warnings\": [\n      {\n        \"path\": \"/orders/1000331\",\n        \"title\":  \"Warning Attribute\",\n        \"code\": \"WRONG_SPELLING\",\n        \"detail\": \"Last name should start with big letter.\",\n        \"detail-structured\": {...},\n        \"jsonpath\": \"[@.orderid=='12345']/invoiceAddress/lastname\",\n        \"logref\": \"key to find in the log\"\n      }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n| Field             | Mandatory | Description                                                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| path              | yes       | called REST path                                                                                     |\n| title             | yes       | short description of the error                                                                       |\n| code              | no        | internal error code (number or enum) of your application / domain (do not use the HTTP status codes) |\n| detail            | no        | long description of the error, perhaps technical details                                             |\n| detail-structured | no        | technical details in JSON structure                                                                  |\n| jsonpath          | no        | JSON field in request which caused the error                                                         |\n| logref            | no        | reference key to find more stuff in the log (as example traceId)                                     |\n\n## Pagination\nInterfaces may return a list with resources (orders, shipments...) and a way to navigate these lists. Please pay attention to the response pattern to identify how to handle lists. There are two common ways list handling is implemented. One way to retrieve the next entry of a list is by using links for navigation the entries. The other is by providing list pages to iterate through lists.\n\nFor pagination, the basic query parameter \"limit\" (e.g. <code class=\"inline\">?limit=10</code>) can be used to define the maximum amount of resulting entities returned per call. The interface itself can reduce the limit lower than your client limit.\n\nAn example entity using links (not pages) to navigate would be:\n```\n{\n  resources: [\n    {\n      ...data of the entity if all or some information will be provided directly...,\n      links: [\n        {\n          href: \"/v1/orders/1234\",  <--- Link to single partner order\n          rel: \"self\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  links: [\n    {\n      href: \"/v1/orders?idGt=1234\", <--- Link to next list of ressources. If not present, no more records exist, currently\n      rel: \"next\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Bulk requests\nAttention: When sending bulk requests to any /products API endpoint, it will be processed asynchronously at the backend.\n\n### Synchronous Answer\nSynchronously will be delivered an endpoint to check the asynchronous processing state.\n```\nHTTP STATUS 202 (Accepted)\n{\n    \"task\": {\n        \"href\": \"/interface/foo/123\",\n        \"id\": \"123\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Check the State of an Endpoint\nThe client can follow the <code class=\"inline\">href</code> to check the state of processing.\n\n#### Best-practice:\nAs long as the `state = pending` the attribute `pingAfter` dictates when to send a new request.\n\nAn example entity would be:\n```\n{\n  \"state\": \"pending\",\n  \"message\": \"is running boy\",\n  \"progress\": \"35\",\n  \"total\": \"100\",\n  \"pingAfter\": \"2019-05-01T13:25:12+0200\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"self\",\n      \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"failed\",\n      \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/failed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"succeeded\",\n      \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/succeeded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Fetching files like PDF and CSV\n\nClients don't have to know the filetype that will be returned from a resource.\nResources serving files will have the appropriate file extension in the URL as shown in the example below.\n\n**Request Headers**\n```\nGET /SomeInvoice.pdf HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\n```\n\nClients can find out the mime-type from the Content-Type header that will be sent in the response (e.g. application/pdf for PDF files and application/csv for CSV files).\n\n**Response Headers**\n\n  ```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 514493\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n```\n\n## Common fields\nCommon fields like time, currency, country codes etc need to follow the standard ISO guidelines unless mentioned otherwise. The fields must report the format they are following on the docs.\n\n### Some standard formats:\n- Time: Accept in any time zone in ISO-8601 format and always reply in UTC.\n\n  Example: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `hh:mm:ss.sss`: `2020-03-12` and `22:33:34.400`\n- Currency: ISO-4217.\n\n  Example: `EUR` for Euros, `GBP` for British Pound Sterling.\n- Country code: ISO-3166-1 alpha-3\n\n  Example: `DEU` for Germany, `NOR` for Norway.\n\n\n# Best Practices\n\n*In the following you can find some best practices for working with our OTTO Market API which will help you to build up a better connection to our marketplace!*\n\n1. Stay within the rate limits\n2. Send data in Batch and fetch data as a list\n3. Take action when getting back http 4** errors\n4. Consider the two-step validation process for creating products\n5. Consider the \"Unchanged\" status during product update or creation\n6. Make sure product intentifier stay the same\n7. Maintain the most relevant attributes for your products\n8. Keep information provided by OTTO up to date\n9. Consider the content requirements for product data\n10. Utilize the MOIN as an identifier for further processes\n11. Use Announced Orders for stock reservation\n12. Consider the delivery type in the shipments\n\n## Stay within the rate limits\n\nEach endpoint of the API has its own rate limits. These limits were set with the aim of ensuring optimal utilization of the server's available resources, maintaining the best quality for all API users, and facilitating the fastest possible processing of requests. Additionally, rate limiting errors can prevent important data from being entered into the system, leading to data discrepancies. Please take into account the rate limits when making your requests and adjust them accordingly if you receive HTTP 429 errors. You can find a complete list of the current rate limits [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Rate-Limiting).\n\n## Send data in Batch and fetch data as a list\n\nTo manage the load, it is advisable if the relevant endpoint makes it possible to send the data in bulk. Each endpoint has a different limit which must be considered. Please make the best possible use of the limit to reduce the number of requests. Some endpoints will perform your request asynchronously when sending data in bulk - for more information about bulk requests have a look [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Bulk-requests).\nIf you want to retrieve data from the OTTO Market API, you should favor a list retrieval. Various parameters are available for retrieving the list in order to filter the list and achieve the desired result. Please make sure that you fetch all pages - for more information about the pagination have a look [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Pagination).\nIn some cases, you can also perform a direct retrieval for individual SKUs. However, you should only do this selectively and always use the list retrieval for regular retrievals.\n\n## Take action when getting back http 4** errors\n\nFor each request you are sending to the OTTO Market API, you will receive a http code. Please make sure that for each client error (http codes 4**) you have a monitoring on your end and take action to reduce the amount of http 4** errors.\nEach client error is caused by incorrect data in the request or payload and needs to be fixed before a retry will be forced. The best way is to show the error codes on your end and only send the data again, after the data were fixed.\n\n\n## Consider the two-step validation process for creating products\n\nProduct uploads go through a two-step validation process. Errors from the first validation stage can be viewed through the import error report ([GET /products/update-tasks](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__progressByProcessId)) and indicate a general product upload issue based on the body request schema. Errors from the second validation stage (otto.de) are embedded in the marketplace status ([GET /products/marketplace-status](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatusList)), and resolving these errors directly generates an offer on otto.de.\n\nPlease also note that the API is asynchronous and you need to get the results via the /products/update-tasks endpoint. This means that the 202: Accepted response you receive after sending a request indicates that we have received your request, but it does not guarantee that we have processed it.\n\n## Consider the \"Unchanged\" status during product update or creation\n\nWhen managing product data, also consider retrieving and taking into account the results for \"unchanged\". Data sets that are found in the unchanged status of the import will be discarded by us. The reason is that exactly the same records have been sent without changes. However, this does not mean that the data sets were processed successfully as data sets that previously had errors and were sent again without any changes will also end up in the \"unchanged\" status. Find more information about the topic [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__unchangedByProcessId).\n\n## Make sure product identifier stay the same\n\nThe combination of **productReference** and **SKU** for one specific EAN cannot be changed once it has been successfully created in OTTO systems. However, if either of the two identifiers needs to be modified, it is necessary to first deactivate either the affected SKU or all SKUs associated with a productReference via the Active-Status endpoint ([POST /products/active-status/](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__updateActiveStatus) active=false).\nAfter deactivating the SKU, the correct product data must be resubmitted. In case you´ve only updated the productReference and the SKU(s) stay the same, it is important to reactivate the affected SKU(s) via the Active-Status endpoint ([POST /products/active-status/](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__updateActiveStatus) active=true). If the SKUs have changed, they will be treated as new SKUs and will start with active=true status.\n\n## Maintain the most relevant attributes for your products\n\nThe assignment of products to filters and specific shopping paths on otto.de is based on the maintained attributes/features in the product data. For this purpose, the provided category list ([GET /products/categories](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getCategoryGroups)) offers indications of the relevance and importance of each attribute/feature. Highly important attributes/features are marked with **relevance=HIGH**. Additionally, the **featureRelevance** indicates the specific use of each attribute (e.g., LEGAL, FILTER, SEARCH, NAVIGATION,...) Please note: All attributes with featureRelevance = LEGAL are mandatory and needs to be maintained.\nYou can also find information about attributes relevant for the variant building on otto.de. The right attributes will be shown withing the **variationThemes**.\nIt is highly recommended to maintain as much attributes with relevance=HIGH to higher your visibility on otto.de.\n\n## Keep information provided by OTTO up to date\n\nAs changes to categories, attributes, and default values can occur, it is important to always have an up-to-date version of the category list ([GET /products/categories](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getCategoryGroups)). This ensures that only valid categories, attributes, and allowed values are transmitted. Similarly, the brand list ([GET /products/brands](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getBrands)) should be kept up to date. Regularly retrieving these lists, ideally on a daily basis, ensures their accuracy and minimizes the potential for errors.\n\n## Consider the content requirements for product data\n\nDuring the product transfer, certain mandatory fields (such as SKU, EAN, category, brandid - see \"required\" in the request body schema of the [POST /products/](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__createOrUpdateProductVariations) endpoint and attributes marked within the category list with featureRelevance=LEGAL must be provided.\nAdditionally, specific formats for attributes/features must be adhered to. Furthermore, the defined formats for attributes/features and the technical requirements for media data (see below) must be considered. Compliance with the content requirements is essential for successful product upload, and conducting a pre-validation for these attributes/features helps minimize potential errors during the product transfer.\n\nTechnical requirements for media data:\n\n\t• File formats: \n\t\t○ Images: JPG, PNG\n\t\t○ Documents: PDF\n\t• Minimum dimensions for images: 500x1000 px (including color tiles and energy labels)\n\t• File name: No special characters or umlauts\n\t• Color space: RGB - Color spaces such as CMYK are not supported\n\t• Maximum image side for image: 4500 px\n        • Main image should be uploaded as a cutout. If not, it has to have a light, neutral background image (example: light gray, white, offwhite, light beige, etc.).\n\n## Utilize the MOIN as an identifier for further processes\n\nAlways verify if the MOIN has been correctly retrieved and stored for each SKU. It should always match the MOIN you´ve get via the [marketplace status](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatusList), and this check should be performed regularly. Please use the list retrieval with the **lastModified** parameter to instantly detect any recent changes. This helps to prevent errors in the second validation stage regarding competition-related issues with products. Additionally, the MOIN can also be used as an identifier for inventory updates. When a SKU gets a MOIN in the OTTO systems, the SKU is correctly created and inventory could be sent. Inventory updates for SKUs which are not correctly created will end up in an error. This approach helps minimize the number of requests and optimizes the overall workload.\n\n## Use Announced Orders for stock reservation\n\nBefore an order receives the status **PROCESSABLE** and is therefore ready for processing, the order remains in the status **ANNOUNCED** for approximately 30 minutes after the customer order has been placed. During this time, the customer is able to cancel all or part of their order directly in their customer account. Customer orders with **paymentMethod=Prepayment** can remain in ANNOUNCED status for up to 10 working days.\nIt is therefore advisable to retrieve the ANNOUNCED orders and reserve inventory accordingly in your system. This can prevent overselling and the associated higher cancellation rate.\n\n## Consider the delivery type in the shipments\n\nWhether or not a **returnTrackingKey** must be provided when submitting a shipment request depends on the attributes maintained for the respective product. Please note that for all products that were created with **deliveryType=PARCEL**, you must also provide a returnTrackingKey when submitting the shipment request.\n\n# Use-Cases\n\n## How to list your first product\n\n*This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you list your first product on the OTTO Market.\nYou´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*\n\nTo list a product you´ll have to do the following:\n\n1. Authenticate\n2. Read valid brands\n3. Read valid categories\n4. Post product\n5. Check update-tasks\n6. Check marketplace status\n7. Create shipping profile\n8. Update product delivery information\n9. Update quantities\n\n### Authenticate\nAt first you have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authentication-Options-for-OTTO-Market-API\n\n### Read valid brands\nNext you have to read the valid brands and find your relevant brand. You can only sell brands where the attribute \"usable\" = true. If you cannot find your brand, you have to create a new one by following the brand creation process in the OTTO Partner Connect Portal.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4/operation/Products-V4__getBrands\n\n### Read valid categories\nFollowing that you´ll need to read the valid categories to know which category to list your products in.\nYou are also be able to read from the list which attributes are mandatory (fe when listing in a specific category and which attribute is relevant for increasing the visibility of a product. Here you have to look after **relevance** and **featureRelevance** to get more information about customer relevance the usage of the attribute on otto.de. All attributes with the **featureRelevance=LEGAL** are mandatory for creating a product.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4/operation/Products-V4__getCategoryGroups\n\n### Post product\nWhen you´ve gathered a valid brand and category, know which attributes you want to add and now it´s finally time to post your first product.\nBy reading the documentation mentioned below you´ll learn which values (e.g. EAN, SKU, productDescription, ...) are required.\nPlease note that the title on otto.de is created by OTTO using your information in the product data. The title is composed of individual fields such as \"category\", \"brandId\", \"productLine\"... The structure can be different for each category. An info about the structure you get also in the category list in the field \"title\".\nYou´ll also find an example request for create or update product variants on this page.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4/operation/Products-V4__getPartnerProducts\n\n### Check update-tasks\nIf you´ve posted your product from the step before, you´ll reveice an http 202 with different links in the response. In the next step you have to check for errors by addressing the \"Update-Tasks\".\nTo get further information you have to proceed a get request with the \"self\" link. When the process state changed from \"pending\" to \"done\", you can fetch further information with the \"failed\", \"succeeded\" or \"unchanged\" link. In the response of the \"self\" link you also can see how much SKU can be found under which link. If there were errors you´ll have to solve these and post your updated product listing again.\nDon´t forget to check the update-tasks another time before carrying on.\n**Attention!** Posting the exact same data a second time is a bad idea since our server is configured to ignore duplicate listings. If a product data would have been ignored, you´ll find the information within the \"unchanged\" link.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4/operation/Products-V4__progressByProcessId\n\n### Check marketplace status\nLast validation step for your product is to check the marketplace status of your SKU.\nThrough Update-Tasks you´ll see if there are technical errors you´ll have to solve. In the marketplace status you´ll see if there are non-technical errors you´ll have to solve. As well the \"moin\" will be shown in the marketplace status at first. We recommend to fetch the marketplace status for each SKU as a list with the parameter \"fromDate\" in a regularer basis to see \"errors\" and get the current \"moin\".\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4/operation/Products-V4__getMarketPlaceStatusList\n\n### Create shipping profile\nAfter your product data is correct and could go live, you need to make sure that the SKU gets all transaction data to go visible for OTTO customer.\nYou can either create your shipping profiles manually in the OTTO Partner Connect Portal or using the API.\nBesides the transportation and default processing time, you need to give information about the deliveryType, Cut-Off-Time and the working days.\nIf you will offer products with different deliveryTypes, you would need to create more than one shipping profiles.\nEach shipping profile will get a shippingProfileId which should be used in the next step.\nYou´ll also find an example request for create, update and get a shipping profile on this page.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/ShippingProfiles-V1\n\n### Update product delivery information\nIf you´ve created shipping profiles and successfully created your first SKUs, you can now add product delivery information to the correct SKUs.\nYou can either work with the default processingTime configured in the shipping profile or update the processingTime for a specific SKU via the POST Request.\nTo reduce error messages, just sent over product delivery information for SKU wherefore you have gotten a \"moin\" via the marketplace status.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Availability-V1/operation/Availability-V1__storeProductDeliveryInformationUsingPOST\n\n### Update quantities\nLastly you´ll have to set the quantities of your product so customers can finally see and buy your product. To reduce error messages, just sent over quantities for SKU wherefore you have gotten a \"moin\" via the marketplace status.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Availability-V1/operation/Availability-V1__storeAvailableQuantitiesUsingPOST\n\n**Congratulations!** You´ve successfully listed your first product on the OTTO Market.\nThe next step is to regularly check for new orders. In the following case you can learn all about the order process and what you have to know about some specifics. [Click here to learn how to do that.](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases/Manage-an-order-from-start-to-finish)\n## Manage an order from start to finish\n\n*This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you fulfilling your first order including subsequent activities on the OTTO Market.\nYou´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*\n\nTo fulfill your first order and manage subsequent activities you´ll have to do the following:\n\n1. Authenticate\n2. Regularly check for new orders\n3. Report order as shipped\n4. Fetch purchase receipt\n5. Regularly screen for return announcements\n6. Process returns\n7. Fetch refund receipt\n\n### Authenticate\nYou´ll have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)\n\n### Regularly check for new orders\nNext you´ll have to regurlarly check for new orders to fulfill. We recommend checking several times a day.\nYou´ll find the different fulfillment states orders can have, their descriptions and common use-cases listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4). We also recommend to fetch orders in the **state=ANNOUNCED** for the reservation of quantity on your end. After the order switched to the **state=PROCESSABLE** (usually after 35 Minutes except for the paymentMethod=prepayment) the customer information will be visible in the order.\nTo carry on with fulfilling your first order the state has to be = PROCESSABLE.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4/operation/Orders-V4__findPartnerOrders\n\n### Report order as shipped\nPackaging the ordered items is next before you can hand them to your carrier and mark the order as shipped.\nWe´ll call it a shipment from this point onward. Every shipment needs a **tracking key** and unless it´s a forwarder shipment you´ll also have to provide a **returnTrackingKey** upfront. If a returnTrackingKey is mandatory for a shipment is dependent on the deliveryType of the sku needed to fulfill in the shipment. You can manage the deliveryType for each sku within the productdata update process.\nPlease read the following endpoint for all technical information:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1/operation/Shipments-V1__createdAndSentShipmentUsingPOST\n\nIf you want to fulfill a sku with more than one package, you´ll need to split the shipment and use [this endpoint](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1/operation/Shipments-V1__createdAndSentMultiparcelShipmentUsingPOST).\n\n### Fetch purchase receipt\nAfter the shipment was successfully created, a purchase receipts will be created on our end. These receipt will be shown to the customer in ther customer account. You can get the purchase receipt by using the receipts endpoint with the **receiptTypes=PURCHASE** as JSON. You also can fetch the receipt as PDF by using the **receiptNumber**. We recommend to use the parameter **receiptTypes** and the parameter **from** and **to**. You also can fetch receipts specifically for one order by using the parameter **salesOrderId**. For further information have a look in the description of the receipts api listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3)\nPlease read the following endpoint for all technical information:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3/operation/Receipts-V3__getReceiptsUsingGET_5\n\n### Regularly screen for return announcements\nCustomers may want to return their order wholly or partially. Return labels will be created through their customer interface and the return status will change to announced. The status misdirected is also displayed to inform you that a customer has mistakenly returned the product to otto. It is recommended to regularly check for announced and misdirected returns using the following endpoint:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V3/operation/Returns-V3__getPositionItemsForUsingGETV3\n\n### Process returns\nReceived returns have to be checked by your warehouse and either accepted or rejected depending on the condition of the return.\nAccepting a return will lead to a customer repayment. You can accept returns using this endpoint:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V3/operation/Returns-V3__receiveAcceptedReturnsV3UsingPOSTV3\n\nIf the condition of the return is unacceptable you´re able to reject the return. If you do so you have to submit a reason for the rejection:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V3/operation/Returns-V3__receiveRejectedReturnsV3UsingPOSTV3\n\n### Fetch refund receipt\nAfter the return was successfully created, a refund receipts will be created on our end. These receipt will be also shown to the customer in ther customer account. You can get the refund receipt by using the receipts endpoint with the **receiptTypes=REFUND** as JSON. Our recommendations in fetching the return receipts are same as they are in fetching the purchase receipt. Use different parameter to filter your request and get your relevant information. For further information have a look in the description of the receipts api listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3)\nPlease read the following endpoint for all technical information:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3/operation/Receipts-V3__getReceiptsUsingGET_5\n\n**Congratulation!**\nYou´ve successfully gone through the whole order processing process on the OTTO Market. You should know which request are necessary for you and which specifics you have to note.\nIn the next step, we want to give you more information about after-sales processes. [Click here to learn how to do that.](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases/Manage-your-after-sales-actions)\n\n## Manage your after sales actions\n\n*This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you with your after sales actions. You will learn what kind of actions you can handle via the OTTO Market API and what you have to consider doing that.\nYou´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*\n\nTo manage your after sales activities you´ll have to do the following:\n\n1. Authenticate\n2. Get in touch with customer\n3. Get customer messages\n4. Give subsequent discounts (price-reductions)\n\n### Authenticate\nYou´ll have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)\n\n### Get in touch with customer\nAfter the customer ordered a product from you, you will receive an encrypted e-mail address in the order. The encrypted e-mail address is part of the invoice address and should be used only in certain cases for the execution of the shipment or return. These cases can take place before and after the shipment is done. i.e. if you have some detailed questions about the delivery address, changes of the trackingNumber, reason why you rejected the return and to clarify the remainder of the goods and so on.\n**Attention!** You must use as sender e-mail address the one that has been stored in the seller information for customer communication.\n\nThere could be also an e-mail address within the delivery address when a customer ordered a product which needs to be fulfilled via a forwarder agency. In this cases the correct e-mail address and phone number of the customer will be shown.\n**Attention!** You may only use this contact information to pass it on to the shipping company so that they can contact the customer to clarify the delivery date.\n\n### Get customer messages\nCustomer are able to contact you in specific cases to the shipment, order or for product relevant questions directly through the customer portal. You will receive the e-mail in the OTTO Partner Connect section \"Customer Communication\" and are able to send your answer directly in the portal. You´ll also have the option to get all customer messages directly to the e-mail adress you´ve stores in the seller information in the OTTO Partner Connect. You can reply directly to incoming mails.\n\n### Give subsequent discounts (price-reductions)\nIf a customer is unsatisfied with the condition of the item he or she will usually return it. Depending on the product and the condition the customer might be interested in keeping the product if a discount is given. Customers usually contact you or OTTO to discuss such an option.\nYou can either grant discounts within the OTTO Partner Connect or via the API within the \"price-reduction\" endpoint.\nThe following endpoint documentation describes how you´re able to provide such a \"price-reduction\":\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Price-Reductions-V1/operation/Price-Reductions-V1__applyPriceReduction\n\n\n# Sandbox\n\n### General\n**Sandbox is the test environment,**\nused for testing an API connection. It provides all the functionalities of the live OTTO Market Interface. All actions and orders there are simulated for testing purposes.\n\nThe login session and the API key in the sandbox environment are completely separated from the production environment.\n\nREST API: **https://sandbox.api.otto.market**\n\n## Getting started\nFollow these steps to start testing on our sandbox environment:\n\n1.  Make yourself familiar with sandbox functionalities.\n2.  Request a sandbox API user:\n    As a **partner (seller)** you first have to make sure that your user have the role \"API-Zugriff\". You can then navigate to the [API-Zugriff](https://portal.otto.market/settings/API). There you can create a Sandbox App for yourself.\n    As a **service provider** please register in our [OTTO Market Service Partner Program](https://servicepartner.otto.market/). Follow all necessary steps and request the \"Sandbox Apps\" Permission to get access to create Sandbox Apps.\n\n3.  Authenticate to our sandbox environment. As Partner have a look at the [Developer's Guide](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authentication-Options-for-OTTO-Market-API) and as service provider have a look at the specific information in [Developer Program](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Sandbox).\n4.  Make yourself familiar with our [Best-Practice test cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Best-Practice-test-cases) and download the testcase file\n5.  Use our Order Generator to create fictional orders. See [Order Generator](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Order-Generator)  below to know, which orders are created.\n6.  Test the API functionality of your application.\n\n## Technical Advice\nPlease note the following information:\n### Authorization\nFor the endpoint like all the other endpoints a valid authorization token has to\nbe sent. If you need further information, please consult the [Developer's Guide](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authentication-Options-for-OTTO-Market-API).\n\n### Sandbox Reset\nTo prevent data overload, our sandbox and its orders are reset monthly at first Sunday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.\\\nAny dynamic data (shipments, returns) is deleted. Old shipments will not be available anymore.\\\nTherefore, you have to create new orders every month.\n\n### Customer-Interactions in Sandbox\nSince there are no real costumers, all interfaces which work with customer data will either mock customer data or reduce the functionalities i.e. returns cannot be announced. Hence, the GET endpoint of returns is retrieving an empty string.\n\n### Product validation\nSubmitted product data is validated in two steps, which will be explainded further on:\n\n**Attention:** Since the sandbox is missing a direct shop integration the second validation is simulated. For more details on how to test these functionalities, please have a look into our [Best-Practise test cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Best-Practice-test-cases), where you can find specific EANs for testing purposes.\n\n**1. Technical validation**\n\nThe first technical validation (syntax and required attributes) takes place after you´ve sent product data using a POST request.\nRead more about uploading products [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__createOrUpdateProductVariations).\nIf your http request was successful (http response state 202), you´ll be provided with four different links (pending, succeeded, failed, unchanged).\nFollowing the links you´ll be able to check which products have been successfully listed, failed, unchanged or are still being processed.\n\n|Status|Explanation|\n|:-|:-|\n|Pending|The product listing is still being processed|\n|Succeeded|The shown products listing was successful|\n|Failed|Listing of all shown products has failed|\n|Unchanged|The request for the listed products is unchanged to the last request|\n\n**2. Shop validation**\n\nThe second step is the shop validation. Results of the shop validation are retrievable using the **marketplace-status endpoint**.\nPlease read the following [documentation](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatusList) on how to use the marketplace status endpoint.\nSubmitted product data always has one of the following four marketplace statuses:\n\n| Status     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pending    | Submitted product data is currently proceeded.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Online     | The SKU is displayed at otto.de. You can find the SKU using the shop link. <br />In some cases, additional information will be shown on how to improve the visibility on otto.de. |\n| Restricted | The SKU is not displayed at otto.de because of an error shown within the error’s container.                                                                                       |\n| Inactive   | The SKU was set inactive via the active-status endpoint and could be reactivated via the active-status endpoint.                                                                  |\n\n**Attention:** Since the sandbox is missing a direct shop integration the second validation is simulated. For more details on how to test these functionalities, please have a look into our [Best-Practise test cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Best-Practice-test-cases), where you can find specific EANs for testing purposes.\n\n## Order Generator\nTo test your API implementation you can generate test orders only on the sandbox environment by sending an empty POST request to the following generation endpoint:\n\n[https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders]()\n\nThis will run 8 predefined scenarios on our sandbox. After the POST request, you will receive 6 orders in \"PROCESSABLE\" status with different combinations of positions and items (e.g. standard and freight delivery). You will also receive 1 prepayment order in \"ANNOUNCED\" and 1 order in \"CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE\" status.\n\nThe generated orders will contain one or more position items with the following products:\n\n| Product Title                       | EAN           | SKU                   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Smartphone »CallMe 1000«            | 1245780164732 | SmartCM1000-schwarz-1 |\n| Fancy Shirt »Flower«                | 4851278936452 | FancyFlower-m-pi      |\n| Rasenmaeher »Turbo V1«              | 9821393948573 | 0440-Rasen-T-V1       |\n| Spedition Wohnlandschaft 3.tlg.     | 8263748321943 | Sped-Wohn-3-98735     |\n| Spedition Kühlschrank »COOL EXTREM« | 7263000981290 | Sped-Kühl084-kombi    |\n\nScenarios:\n\n| Scenarios        | Status                   | Comment                                                                                                              |\n|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 | PROCESSABLE              | Scenario 4 inclusive discount                                                                                        |\n| 5                | ANNOUNCED                | Order with payment method PREPAYMENT awaiting customer's payment<br>Order includes weeePickup on position item level |\n| 6                | CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE | Order with payment method PREPAYMENT which has been cancelled since the customer didn't pay                          |\n\nPlease use the generated orders to test the interaction with Orders, Shipments and Returns.\n\nIf you want to create a single scenario you can do that by sending an empty POST to:\n\n[https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario\\{scenarionumber\\}]()\n\ne.g. [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario1]()\n\n## Best-Practice test cases\n\nWe´ve come up with mulitple test cases to help you test the basic functionalities needed for each endpoint when offering your service to an OTTO Market Seller.\nThe test cases should be tested within the sandbox environment. If you´re interested in feedback from our service provider management you can send screenshots of the test results [here](https://account.otto.market/s/ticketanlegen?category=Supportrequest&Unterkategorie=technicalInterfaces&Interface__c=api&Subject=%5BOTTO+Market+API%5D+Service+Partner+Test+Cases).\n\nThe Best-Practice testcases should help you as a developer to understand the behavior and the interdependencies between different APIs.\nWith the test cases you can get hints for testing the interfaces and to reproduce the [Use-Cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases) within the sandbox-environment.\n\nWe´re referring to the test orders created using the *test order generator* within the sandbox environment. Please read the section [Order Generator](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Order-Generator) on how to create test orders.\n\nYou can download a file where you can find the Best-Practice test cases [here](https://live.divae.developer.otto.market/_Resources/Persistent/1/d/1/7/1d17e046750554dbdb01d15aba7a53aa989d0e4e/Best-Practice-Testcases.xlsx).\n\n\n# Developer Program\nThis section describes how a service provider can integrate with OTTO Market API.\nThe developer program aims at equipping the service providers with authentication and authorization for accessing the OTTO Market API `on behalf of the partner`.\n\n## Target Group\nThe Developer Program is intended primarily for service providers who want to exchange data for OTTO Market Partners and offer their service to other sellers. OTTO Market Partners who would like to develop their own OTTO Market API connection use their own API user and can find more information [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authentication-Options-for-OTTO-Market-API).\n\n## Registration as Service Provider\nIf you want to register as a service provider who needs to access Partner data, please follow the steps at [servicepartner.otto.market](https://servicepartner.otto.market/register).\nYou'll receive email notifications for any approval / denial of registration requests.\n\nAfter submitting your registration you will get access to the basic functionalities of our portal. To tailor your experience and unlock additional features, head over to the Permission Management Section. To start the journey you have to request your first permission for creating Sandbox Apps. With our confirmation, you will receive 30 days' test access to the sandbox environment for getting to know the inferfaces and estimate your effort without completing the registration process.\nIf you decide to integrate, complete the registration by filling out the self-disclosure form. You will receive the form at the end of the 30-day test access period. We will grant you unlimited sandbox access afterwards.\n\nAt the point when you decide to go live and roll-out your service, you can request the permission for creating private production apps in the permission management. You need to start working with the production environment in private access first for test and learn with pilot integrations. Afterwards you can request public production access by request the right permission.\n\nFor more information about the registration and integration process, please have a look at [servicepartner.otto.market](https://servicepartner.otto.market).\n\n## Private and Public Access for Service Provider\n\nOnce you´ve done with testing, requested the permission **private production apps** and we cofirmed the permission, you can now create private apps in the Production environemnt.  (Read more about the difference between private and public apps [here](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Private-and-Public-Apps).)\n\n### Getting Public Access\n\nIf you want to get public access follow the steps below:\n\n1. Login to OTTO Partner Connect portal and navigate to the Permission Management\n2. Request the permission \"Public Production Apps\"\n3. Select necessary scopes for your public access\n4. Done! Your request will be reviewed by OTTO Market. You'll receive email notifications for approval / denial of your request.\n\n*Please note: OTTO Market will perform a quality check for each selected scope. You only can go public after passed the quality check and finished an OTTO Market Training. The colleagues will give you more information during the integration process.*\n\n## Private and Public Apps\n\n#### Private Apps\n\nPrivate apps can be created by developer with the permission \"Private Production Apps\". If a OTTO Market partner wants to install a private app, an unique app invitation link (\"Einladungslink\") is required.\n\n**Generate an app invitation link**\nYou can generate an unique app invitation link for an app by following the steps below:\n\n1. Login to the [OTTO Partner Connect](https://portal.otto.market/profile/Dienstleisterprofil) portal.\n2. Navigate to the [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) and [Sandbox Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/sp-sandbox-apps/apps) page for production and sandbox apps respectively.\n3. Click on the three dots (…) right to the app name for which you want to create an invitation link.\n4. In the dropdown menu select \"Einladungslink generieren\".\n5. A popup window will be displayed. Copy the link from this window - it will not show up again.\n6. Done! You can now share the app invitation link with a OTTO Market partner.\n\n`Note:` You should be aware of the following:\n- After closing the popup window with the invitation link you won't be able to see this exact invitation link again.\n- You can create as much invitation links as you want to.\n- There is no possibility to show all invitation links created for a specific app.\n- Every app invitation link is only valid for 24 hours and can be used only once. (When it is used or expired the link will become invalid and you have to create a new one.)\n- If a partner clicks on the link but don't grant consent the link remains valid (until it is either expired or consent is granted).\n\n#### Public Apps\n\nPublic apps can only be created developer with the permission \"Public Production Apps\". (For getting public access refer to [Getting Public Access](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Production).)\nIn order to install a public app, an universally valid installation link (\"Installationslink\") is required. After creating a public app this link is displayed in the app details page. You can share this link whereever you want.\nYou can also add an optional parameter \"state\" to this installation link, which preserves the state of your application page and returns user back to that state after they install. If this optional parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with the optional state.\nBut be aware that it is universally valid meaning you cannot control which partner will install your app.\n\n## Scopes\n\nScopes corresponds to [OAuth scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/). They are used for providing fine-grained access control to the OTTO Market APIs. Scopes need to be used via the authorization in the client credential flow or the authorization code flow. \n\n### Scopes for OTTO Market APIs\nThe below table gives mapping of displayed scope names in UI to the scope names to be used for fetching token\n\n| Display Name      | Scope Name (To be used in fetching token) |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Installation      | installation                              |\n| PartnerId         | partnerId                                 |\n| Developer         | developer                                 |\n| Products          | products                                  |\n| Orders            | orders                                    |\n| Receipts          | receipts                                  |\n| Returns           | returns                                   |\n| Price Reduction   | price-reduction                           |\n| Shipments         | shipments                                 |\n| Quantities        | quantities                                |\n| Shipping Profiles | shipping-profiles                         |\n| Availability\t    | availability                              |\n\n### Content declaration of available scopes\n\n#### Installation\nThe installation interface allows a service provider to get the installation details of a Partner\n\n#### PartnerId\nThe partnerId interface allows a service provider, access to the partner's partner id.\n\n#### Developer\nThe developer interface allows a service provider to fetch an installation token\n\n#### Products\n\nThe product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V4).\n\n#### Quantities - depcrecated and will be shut down to the end of March 25. Use the Availability Interface for updating quantities.\n\nOnce the products have been successfully transmitted using the products scope, only the quantities are missing to make the products available to the end customer on otto.de. For this purpose the Quantity Interface allows partners and service providers to update the available quantity for a specific SKU.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Quantities-V2).\n\n#### Shipping Profiles\n\nWith this interface you can create, change and manage shipping profiles of the otto market partners. \n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/ShippingProfiles-V1).\n\n#### Availability\n\nOnce the products have been successfully transmitted using the products scope, your need to send quantities to make the products available to the end customer on otto.de. \nAs well you need to connect the sku to existing shipping profiles for the delivery information. \nFor this purpose the Availability Interface allows partners and service providers to update necessary information to make a SKU available on otto.de.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Availability-V1).\n\n#### Orders\n\nThis interface allows partners and service providers to view orders and associated position items. It also allows to send cancellations on order and position item level.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4).\n\n#### Shipments\n\nThis interface should be used to report that shipments have been handed over to the carrier for final delivery to the customer. You can also get access to Return-Shipments for retrieving track and trace data for returns from the customer to the partner warehouse.\n\nShipments - Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1).\nReturn-Shipments - Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/ReturnShipments-V1).\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis scope enables the user to manage returns. This includes retrieving a list of announced returns, accepting and declining returns.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V3).\n\n#### Receipts\n\nOTTO Market provides receipts to the customers to document financial processes. The scopes enables users to download these documents as a PDF or a JSON.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V2).\n\n#### Price Reduction\n\nThis endpoint enables sellers to apply price reductions to shipped products if the customer is unsatisfied and asks for a partial refund instead of returning the product completely.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Price-Reductions-V1).\n\n## Sandbox vs Production\nSandbox apps are used to test your API in sandbox environment, when you are approved for the permission \"Sandbox Apps\" by the OTTO Market team. These apps have unrestricted scopes access, so you can create sandbox apps for any scope even if you don´t need them in the production environment. For creating and testing with sandbox apps, please see [Access to Sandbox](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Sandbox).\n\nAs the name states, production apps are for production environment. This can be created after you have an approval from OTTO Market team for the permission \"Private Production Apps\". Once you have the approval, you can request for \"Public Production Apps\", to create public apps.\nAn OTTO Market Partner has to provide consent, in order for you to access their production data. The detailed flow is described in the [Access to Production](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Production) section below.\n\n\n## Access to Sandbox\nOnce your permission request for \"Sandbox Apps\" is approved, you can start using [Sandbox Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/sp-sandbox-apps/apps).\n\n### Creating sandbox test users\nIn [Usermanagement UI](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Nutzerverwaltung) Service Providers can create their own test users for sandbox.\nThis test user can be used for authenticating against sandbox apps\n\nValid email is required for sandbox users. Upon creation of user, a password setting mail will be sent to the given sandbox user emailId\n\n**Please note:** Sandbox users are considered as part of the service provider count itself. You can create a max of 10 users (service providers + sandbox) by default.\n\nPlease also have a look in the [Download section](https://servicepartner.otto.market/en/downloads/downloads.html) of servicepartner.otto.market. There you can find a Step-by-Step Sandbox guide for testing the integration ([here](https://live.divae.servicepartner.otto.market/_Resources/Persistent/1/7/6/b/176bc5208c1cf57e27bf58b98c10752306920a50/Sandbox%20guide%20for%20testing%20the%20integration%20of%20a%20retailer.pdf)).\n\n### Creating sandbox apps\nIn create apps UI, you need to provide the following details,\n- unique name\n- homepage URL\n- authorization callback URL - Refer below section for more info\n- [scopes](docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) - All scopes will be listed in sandbox.\n- app type - Refer [Private and Public Apps](docs#section/Developer-Program/Private-and-Public-Apps) for more info\n\n#### Post Installation Redirect URL\nTest Partner will be redirected to your post installation redirect URL after successfully installing your app.\n\n#### Authorization callback URL\n1. Post successful redirection, you will initiate authorization code flow. Test Partner logs in with their credential. On verifying identity, partner will be redirected to your app's authorization callback URL with auth code.\n2. If you intend to incorporate query parameters in your REDIRECT_URI, ensure to suffix the url with an asterisk (*)\n\n#### App ID\nA unique app ID which will be used for identifying a service provider app.\nWhen a partner installs this app, this app ID will be used for fetching the installation details.\n\n#### Installation Link\n\nThis unique, publicly accessible link is intended for OTTO Market partners to facilitate app installation.\n\n- **Optional State Parameter**: An optional `\"state\"` parameter can be added to the installation link to retain the application page’s state. If this parameter is provided, it will be preserved and included in the app’s Post Installation Redirect URL. If the `state` parameter is not provided, the user will still be redirected to the Post Installation Redirect URL, but without the `state` data.\n\n- **Reinstallation Behavior**: If a partner has already installed the app and clicks the installation link again, they will be redirected to the Installations Overview in their OPC account, bypassing the standard installation flow.\n\nYou can simply add this link as a hyperlink on your website for convenient partner access.\n\n#### Client ID & Client Secret\nCredentials to be used for authenticating & authorising your app with OTTO authorisation server for\nfetching installation details of partner\n\n#### Version\nDenotes the version of the app\n\n#### Version End Date\nThis version will remain functional until the specified date. Any changes must be scheduled at least 4 weeks in advance(Note:- Once an app version end date is set, it cannot be modified. Please contact the helpdesk if an update is required.)\n\n#### Activation Date\nDate when communication with partners begins for a new version release.\n\n## Access to Production\nOnce you are satisfied with everything you have tested in the sandbox, you can request the permission \"Public Production Apps\" in the permission management in the OTTO Partner Connect Portal.\nWhen approved, you can start creating production apps using [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) in OTTO Partner Connect.\n\n### Creating apps\nIn create apps UI, you need to provide the following details,\n- unique name\n- homepage URL\n- authorization callback URL - Refer below section for more info\n- [scopes](docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) - Only scopes approved for you will be shown\n- app type (only if the service provider has public access)\n\n#### Post Installation Redirect URL\nPartner will be redirected to your post installation redirect URL after successfully installing your app.\n\n#### Authorization callback URL\n1. Post successful redirection, you will initiate authorization code flow. Partner logs in with their credential. On verifying identity, partner will be redirected to your app's authorization callback URL with auth code.\n2. If you intend to incorporate query parameters in your REDIRECT_URI, ensure to suffix the url with an asterisk (*)\n\n#### App ID\nA unique app ID which will be used for identifying a service provider app.\nWhen a partner installs this app, this app ID will be used for fetching the installation details.\n\n#### Installation Link\n\nThis unique, publicly accessible link is intended for OTTO Market partners to facilitate app installation.\n\n- **Optional State Parameter**: An optional `\"state\"` parameter can be added to the installation link to retain the application page’s state. If this parameter is provided, it will be preserved and included in the app’s Post Installation Redirect URL. If the `state` parameter is not provided, the user will still be redirected to the Post Installation Redirect URL, but without the `state` data.\n\n- **Reinstallation Behavior**: If a partner has already installed the app and clicks the installation link again, they will be redirected to the Installations Overview in their OPC account, bypassing the standard installation flow.\n\nYou can simply add this link as a hyperlink on your website for convenient partner access.\n\n#### Client ID & Client Secret\nCredentials to be used for authenticating & authorising your app with OTTO authorisation server for\nfetching installation details of partner\n\n#### Version\nDenotes the version of the app\n\n#### Version End Date\nThis version will remain functional until the specified date. Any changes must be scheduled at least 4 weeks in advance.(Note:- Once an app version end date is set, it cannot be modified. Please contact the helpdesk if an update is required.)\n\n#### Activation Date\nDate when communication with partners begins for a new version release.\n\n### Extend scopes on an existing App\nIf you want to add more scopes to an existing app, use the \"extend scopes\" functionality to select the additional scopes you wish to access. When you extend the scopes, a new version of the app will be created, replicating the previous app and retaining its values. Please note that the appName cannot be edited, but all other configurations can be modified if needed.\n### Why extend scopes instead of creating a new app?\n- You should create a new app if you have a completely new use case or functionality that you want to exclude from your general service I.e. you are implementing a completely new API interface with new functions on your site and you are expanding the range of the service that you are offering on the OTTO Market.\n- However, if you only need to access new scopes while retaining the existing app configurations, extending the scopes is the preferred option.\n- When you extend the scopes, a new version of the app is created, as mentioned earlier. Partners who installed the previous version will be automatically notified once the activation date is reached that a new version is available. They can then choose whether or not to install the new version.\n- The main advantage of extending the scope of an existing app is the automated and simplified communication by OTTO. OTTO Market Partners will be notified via email and banners in the OTTO Partner Connect portal. This greatly reduces the communication effort required to migrate partners on your side.\n## Installation of app by an OTTO Partner (Sandbox | Production)\n\n<img src=\"/docs/app_installation_flow.jpg\" alt=\"App Installation\"/>\n\n\n1. **Share the Installation Link with a `state` Parameter (Optional)**  \n   The application's installation link can be shared with your partners in the following ways. If needed, include a \"state\" parameter for tracking the installer:\n\n  - Through your platform or portal.\n  - Via an email sent to your partners.\n  - Through OPC for a versioned app (when upgrading via OPC, adding a `state` param might not be possible).\n\n   Your partner then navigates to the installation link and installs the app.\n\n   **Security Notes:**\n  - If you include a `state` parameter, ensure it does not expose any sensitive data such as `userId` or similar information. Instead, consider using a secure, random, unguessable value that is only understandable by your system. This value should be valid for a limited time (e.g., 2 minutes) and should be tied to the specific installer session.\n  - One way to achieve this is by generating a random token that can be mapped to the installer’s identity within your system. This token should be designed to be unguessable and resistant to attacks, such as using UUIDs or secure random generators.\n\n2. **Redirect to Post-Installation URL and Authenticate the Installer**  \n   After installation, your partner is redirected to your app’s post-installation URL. If a `state` parameter was included, it will be appended to this URL. At this point, you must authenticate the installer using your IDP.\n\n  - Upon landing at the post-installation URL, authenticate the installer using your IDP.\n  - Once authenticated, store the installer’s identity (e.g., unique installer ID) for linking purposes.\n\n\n3. **Authenticate the User Against OTTO’s IDP Using OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow**  \n   After authenticating the user with your IDP, initiate the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with OTTO’s IDP. During this process:\n\n  - Pass the installer’s identity (or a relevant identifier) as a custom query parameter in the `redirect_uri` (e.g., `installer_id` or similar). This is for the purpose of linking the `installationId` obtained from OTTO to the corresponding installer ID in your system.\n  - You can use any query parameter name (e.g., `installer_id`) in the `redirect_uri` that suits your needs, as long as your system understands it.\n\n   **Security Recommendation for Installer Identity:**\n  - Instead of passing the raw `installerId`, consider passing an encrypted or random, unguessable token that is valid for a short time. For example, generate a token that combines a timestamp (for time-based validity) and a secure random value (e.g., `encrypt(randomToken + currentTime)`). This value should only be understandable by your system and be mapped to the installer’s identity.\n\n   3.1 **Redirect the User to OTTO’s Authorization Endpoint:**  \n   Use the scopes `installation` and `partnerId` to initiate the flow. For example:\n\n   ```\n    https://sandbox.api.otto.market/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}&scope=installation%20partnerId\n   ```\n\n   3.2 **User Logs in and Authorizes the App:**  \n   The user logs in and verifies their identity through OTTO’s login page.\n\n   3.3 **Receive Authorization Code:**  \n   Upon successful authorization, your app will receive the authorization code at the specified redirect URI.\n\n   3.4 **Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token:**  \n   Make a POST request to the token endpoint to get an access token:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   grant_type=authorization_code&client_id={yourClientId}&client_secret={yourClientSecret}&code={yourAuthorizationCode}&redirect_uri={https://yourApp/callback}\n   ```\n\nFor more information on implementing the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow, please refer to the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) section of the OAuth2 standard documentation. You can retrieve the necessary endpoints from the OpenID Connect well-known configuration:\n\n- Sandbox Well-Known Endpoint: [Sandbox Well-Known Endpoint](https://sandbox.api.otto.market/sec-api/auth/realms/deepsea-sandbox/.well-known/openid-configuration)\n- Production Well-Known Endpoint: [Production Well-Known Endpoint](https://api.otto.market/sec-api/auth/realms/otto-partner/.well-known/openid-configuration)\n\n**Note:**  \nIf your app’s post-installation URL is the same as the OAuth2 callback URL, passing the installer’s ID in the `redirect_uri` is unnecessary, as you’ve already retained it.\n\n4. **Retrieve and Link the Installation ID with the Installer’s Identity**  \n   Once you have authenticated the user against OTTO’s IDP, retrieve the installation ID:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   GET /v1/apps/{appId}/installation HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Authorization: Bearer {access_token}\n   ```\n\n   **Response:**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"installationId\": \"string\",\n     \"appVersion\": \"V3\",\n     \"existingInstallations\": [\n       {\n         \"installationId\": \"string\",\n         \"state\": \"ENABLED\",\n         \"appVersion\": \"V1\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **Note:**  \n   For first-time installations, no values will appear under `existingInstallations`. Store the installation ID alongside the installer’s identity in your system.\n\n5. **Fetch a Developer Access Token Using Client Credentials Flow**  \n   To fetch a developer access token, implement the Client Credentials Flow:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}&scope=developer\n   ```\n\n   Replace `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{CLIENT_SECRET}` with your client details.\n\n6. **Retrieve an Installation Access Token and Access OTTO Market APIs**  \n   With the developer access token, obtain an installation access token by making a POST request:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   POST /v1/apps/{appId}/installations/{installationId}/accessToken HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Authorization: Bearer {access_token}\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   scope={SCOPE_VALUES}\n   ```\n\n   **Response:**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"access_token\": \"token\",\n     \"expires_in\": 1800\n   }\n   ```\n\nPlease note that in step 6, the Host header should be either `sandbox.api.otto.market` or `api.otto.market`. Additionally, the Authorization header should include the value `Bearer {access_token}` obtained in step 5.\n\nYou can now use this installation access token to authenticate your requests when accessing OTTO Market APIs. Include the access token in the Authorization header with the value Bearer {access_token} for subsequent API calls.\nPlease note that once the access token expires, repeat steps 5 and 6 to obtain a new access token and installation access token respectively. Use the updated tokens for continued access to OTTO Market APIs.\n"

      "description": "### Product interfaces\nThe product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.\n\nThe API offers endpoints for different aspects of product data management:\n\n- The \"Products\" endpoint can be used to send the products to the OTTO Market. The POST operation will return a state \"PENDING\" and a process id which identifies the processing of the request. This process id is delivered in the response body of the POST request as a collection of links (like \"update-tasks/8a9ab7ec-b1ba-4917-bffa-e1d22f2ebe1b\". These links can be used in a GET operation to look at the results of the processing of the sent product data. You as a partner might send many variations in one request, so the processing could take some time, therefore we only offer an asynchronous access to the received product data. The GET operation of the \"Products\" endpoint can be used after the end of the processing to watch the representation of the product in the exact state sent by you. The state changes to \"DONE\", when the operation is finished and you get an executive summary of the operation. This summary shows the total amount of variations in the process and breaks it down to the amount of variations, which were processed successfully, failed or were send unchanged.\n\n- The \"Product Active Status\" endpoint allows you to pull the products from otto.de, or to put them back to visibility on otto.de. For this you have the POST operation. There is also a GET operation to view the state of products.\n\n- Use the \"Marketplace Status\" endpoint to query the status of the product variations on the OTTO marketplace. If a product variation has been processed without errors, the status includes the link to the product variation on otto.de.\n\n- The \"Brands\" endpoint gives you all the brands OTTO Market knows and can reference. You should use this endpoint to make the brand in your products fit to OTTO Market brand IDs.\n\n- The \"Categories\" endpoint gives you all the assortment categories OTTO Market has defined, so you should use this endpoint to make the category names in your products fit to OTTO Market categories and their exact names.\n\n### Example\nA typical sequence dealing with our interfaces would be:\n```\n1. You query the Brands interface and match the brand names in Your products to the names in the received brands.\n2. You query the Categories interface and match the category names in Your products to the names in the received categories.\n3. You use the POST endpoints from the Products interface to send Your products to Otto Market\n4.

2024-10-07 | **Added** <br/> The product safety information now includes the additional properties regionCode and url. Specifying the email and/or url is mandatory when providing product safety information.  | \n| 2024-05-28 | **Added** <br/> Possibility to add information for product safety<br/> - productSafety is a new top level container for providing manufacturer / importer information. Will be obligatory from V4. |\n| 2022-09-22 | We are proudly introducing our products API v3 with a lot of changes compared to v2, that we will describe here. Further information for v3 can also be found in the OPC-helpdesk. **v2 will be supported until 31th of March 2023.** After this date, the products interface will reject requests via v2.<br/><br/>**Changed**<br/> - handling brands: We introduce the brandId, which will replace the name of the brand. You can find the brandIds and the matching brand-names at `v3/products/brands`. The new brandId keeps stable, even if the name of a brand will be adjusted in the future. The brandId allows us to seperate between different brands with the same name. The `usable`-tag at every brand gives you the information, if you are allowed to setup products from this brand or you need a special permission for that.<br/> - restrict the length of the attributes `productLine`, `Besondere Merkmale` and `Set-Info` to 70 characters each. The product-title on otto.de is composed based on the selected category. You can find the title-templates in the category-endpoint. These 3 attributes are part of most title-templates. We need to restrict the length to avoid overly long product-titles, which have a bad influence on the customer experience.<br/> - the status of an upload is now more transparent. We now differenciate just between the upload-state \"in progress\" and \"done\". The state \"failed\" isn't shown any more. For your convenience, we also show a more detailed status of the processing, which were included in the upload.<br/> - The asset-links may contain a maximum of 2083 characters.<br/> - Prices should be transmitted with Euro as currency and may contain 2 decimal places. <br/><br/>**Added**<br/> - `deliveryType` offers a new value for goods, which have to be transported to customers by heavy trucks. It is called `FORWARDER_HEAVYDUTY`.<br/> - You can now, if you wish, limit a customer's order in the number of items per order. This can make sense for products where demand is greater than supply. Additionally to the attribute `maxOrderQuantity` known from v2, you can limit the order with a specific period `periodInDays`. A `maxOrderQuantity` with a `quantity` of 5 and a `periodInDays` of 30 means, that a customer can order 5 pieces of this variation in 30 days.<br/><br/> **Removed** <br/> - the attribute `offeringStartDate` is deleted<br/> - `UPC` and `ISBN` are deleted |\n"

      "description": "### Product interfaces\nThe product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.\n\nThe API offers endpoints for different aspects of product data management:\n\n- The \"Products\" endpoint can be used to send the products to the OTTO Market. The POST operation will return a state \"PENDING\" and a process id which identifies the processing of the request. This process id is delivered in the response body of the POST request as a collection of links (like \"update-tasks/8a9ab7ec-b1ba-4917-bffa-e1d22f2ebe1b\". These links can be used in a GET operation to look at the results of the processing of the sent product data. You as a partner might send many variations in one request, so the processing could take some time, therefore we only offer an asynchronous access to the received product data. The GET operation of the \"Products\" endpoint can be used after the end of the processing to watch the representation of the product in the exact state sent by you. The state changes to \"DONE\", when the operation is finished and you get an executive summary of the operation. This summary shows the total amount of variations in the process and breaks it down to the amount of variations, which were processed successfully, failed or were send unchanged.\n\n- The \"Product Active Status\" endpoint allows you to pull the products from otto.de, or to put them back to visibility on otto.de. For this you have the POST operation. There is also a GET operation to view the state of products.\n\n- Use the \"Marketplace Status\" endpoint to query the status of the product variations on the OTTO marketplace. If a product variation has been processed without errors, the status includes the link to the product variation on otto.de.\n\n- The \"Brands\" endpoint gives you all the brands OTTO Market knows and can reference. You should use this endpoint to make the brand in your products fit to OTTO Market brand IDs.\n\n- The \"Categories\" endpoint gives you all the assortment categories OTTO Market has defined, so you should use this endpoint to make the category names in your products fit to OTTO Market categories and their exact names.\n\n### Example\nA typical sequence dealing with our interfaces would be:\n```\n1. You query the Brands interface and match the brand names in Your products to the names in the received brands.\n2. You query the Categories interface and match the category names in Your products to the names in the received categories.\n3. You use the POST endpoints from the Products interface to send Your products to Otto Market\n4.

      "name": "Orders-V4",
      "description": "### Order Interface\n\nThis interface allows partners and service providers to view orders and associated position items. It also allows sending cancellations on order and position item level.\n\nThe term *sales order* refers to a customer's order with items from different partners. The term *partner order* refers to a customer's order containing only the positions of a single partner.<br>\nThis interface is only concerned with partner orders.\n\nA position item is the physical product a customer has ordered. A checkout with a product quantity greater than one will produce unique position items within the partner order.\n\n### Authentication\n\nEvery operation on this interface requires proper credentials. Partners only have visibility on their own orders.\n\n\n### Fulfillment States\n\nA position item can stay in different fulfillment states (attribute 'fulfillmentStatus'):\n\n1. ANNOUNCED -> An ordered position item which shall be reserved for the customer but shall not be shipped yet. The position item can still be cancelled by the marketplace and the customer. The address of the customer is not visible in this state. \n2. PROCESSABLE -> This position item is ready to be fulfilled.\n3. SENT -> This position item was shipped. It was processed by the [Shipments interface](./docs#tag/Shipments-V1).\n4. RETURNED -> This position item was returned. It was processed by the [Returns interface](./docs#tag/Returns-V2).\n5. CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER -> This position item was cancelled by the partner and won't be processed any further.\n6. CANCELLED\\_BY\\_MARKETPLACE -> This position item was cancelled by the marketplace and won't be processed any further. In case of a partner termination all position items in state ANNOUNCED or PROCESSABLE will be cancelled.\n\n### Possible State Transitions\n\n<img src=\"/docs/Overview_fulfillment_status_transitions.svg\" alt=\"Fulfillment status transitions\"/>\n\nThe position item states determine the whole order's lifecycle state:\n\n* The order will be classified as ANNOUNCED, PROCESSABLE, SENT, or RETURNED if at least one position item is in an analogous state **AND** all other position items have the same or higher state according to above-mentioned list.\n* The order will also be classified as CANCELLED\\_BY\\_MARKETPLACE or CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER if it has at least one position item in fulfillment state CANCELLED\\_BY\\_MARKETPLACE resp. CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER.\n\nThe latest lifecycle change is recorded in order attribute 'lifecycleChangeDate'. You can choose to quey by lifecycle state or position item state by using the ```mode```\n\n\n\n### Fetching Orders\n\nOrders can be fetched individually by ```salesOrderId```/ ```orderNumber``` or as a list by using different filter criteria.\n\n#### Common Use Cases\n\n##### Fetch open orders\n\nOrders can be constantly created. After the payment confirmation orders change to state PROCESSABLE. To fetch orders after they became processable this REST call can be used\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=PROCESSABLE\n```\n\nIf there is a next link it can be followed until there are no new orders. To start at a certain date the fromDate can be used, which relates to the lifecycleChangeDate, which in this case is when order became PROCESSABLE. \n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=PROCESSABLE&orderColumnType=ORDER_LIFECYCLE_DATE&fromDate=2023-07-01T00:00:00Z\n```\n\nThis works in a similar way for other status and combinations, for example\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=PROCESSABLE,SENT\n```\n\n##### Fetch all orders for a day\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fromOrderDate=2023-07-01T00:00:00Z&toOrderDate=2023-07-02T00:00:00Z&orderColumnType=ORDER_DATE\n```\n\nThe next link can be followed until there are no orders left. \n\n##### Fetch all orders with returned positions\n\nTo fetch orders with at least one returned position the following query can be used\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=RETURNED&mode=AT_LEAST_ONE&orderColumnType=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE&fromDate=2023-07-01T00:00:00Z\n```\n\n##### Fetch a single order\n\nBy ```salesOrderId```\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders/82f3e02f-2f56-448d-8f3b-d42f5a475119\n```\n\nBy ```orderNumber```\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders/v8pnyhq2nh\n```\n\n#### Performance Hints\n\nThere can be a lot of combinations of parameters for the API which will result in varying response times. For best performance results try to use either ```fromDate``` or ```fromOrderDate```/ ```toOrderDate```, not both at the same time. Also orderColumnType works best with ```fromDate``` instead of ```fromOrderDate```/ ```toOrderDate```.\n\n\n#### Pagination\n\nPaging will occur if the number of returned orders exceeds the current limit (request parameter ```limit```).\n\n#### Example\n\n```\n{\n      \"resources\": [\n        { \n          ...\n        }\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"links\": [\n        {\n          \"href\": \"/v4/orders?nextcursor=eyJmZiI6MTY4ODU0Mzk5MDUxMCwicGlmIjoiMTAwNjI1MCIsIm0iOiJCVUNLRVQiLCJvY3QiOiJPUkRFUl9MSUZFQ1lDTEVfREFURSIsIm9kIjoiQVNDIiwic3RmIjoic2FsZXNPcmRlcklkIiwibHNvaSI6ImUxM2IwYTMyLWU1ZTMtNDEwYi05YWQ2LTliZWRlY2MwNzVjNiIsInNvaWNyIjpmYWxzZX0\",\n          \"rel\": \"next\"\n        }\n      ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing  ```/v4/orders?nextcursor=eyJmZiI6MTY4ODU0Mzk5MDUxMCwicGlmIjoiMTAwNjI1MCIsIm0iOiJCVUNLRVQiLCJvY3QiOiJPUkRFUl9MSUZFQ1lDTEVfREFURSIsIm9kIjoiQVNDIiwic3RmIjoic2FsZXNPcmRlcklkIiwibHNvaSI6ImUxM2IwYTMyLWU1ZTMtNDEwYi05YWQ2LTliZWRlY2MwNzVjNiIsInNvaWNyIjpmYWxzZX0``` here would receive the next slice of records; a missing next link indicates no further records.\n\n\n\n\n### Cancellation\n\nPosition items of an order can be cancelled. These position items must be in state PROCESSABLE or ANNOUNCED.<br>\n**Partner cancellations in general lead to customer dissatisfaction and should be avoided.**\n\nCancellation is possible for only a single position item or the whole order:\n\n- to cancel a single position item send a POST request '/v4/orders/{salesOrderId}/positionItems/{positionItemId}/cancellation'\n- to cancel the whole order send a POST request '/v4/orders/{salesOrderId}/cancellation'\n\nEvery position item which is in fulfillment status PROCESSABLE or ANNOUNCED will be changed to CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER. If there was a cancellation request from the customer the ```cancellationReason``` will be set to CANCELLED_ON_CUSTOMER_WISH\n\nThe cancellation operations might take a moment until the result is visible on a subsequent fetch request. Conflicts will be reported in an error response.\n\n\n### Changelog\n\nThis changelog will document all relevant changes in our interface.  \nKudos to https://keepachangelog.com/de/1.0.0/\n\n\n| Date

This will help us understand and if possible, reduce \"bad\" returns.\nSome examples of reject reasons could be \"WRONG_ITEM\", \"EXCHANGE\", \"ITEM_NOT_IN_THE_PARCEL\", etc. </br></br>\n\n\nWe expect the following values for the condition:\n* A for \"in original packaging\" \n* B for \"in mint condition\"\n* C for \"slightly used\"\n* D for \"heavily used\"\n* E for \"mistake (Delivery incomplete, not available,...)\"\n\nIf you have already accepted a return, it cannot be rejected again afterwards. </br>\nHowever, if you feel you have changed your mind about a rejected return, you still have the option to accept the return afterwards.\n\n\n### Changelog\n\nThis changelog will document all relevant changes in our interface.<br/>\nKudos to https://keepachangelog.com/de/1.0.0/\n\n\n| Date       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2024-03-18 | We are introducing API v3 in which **return rejection reason should be one of the enum values; rather than a free text earlier**. </br></br> From v3, return acceptance can also have a reason as an optional enum value.</br></br>**API version v2 will be supported till 30th September, 2024.</br></br>After this date, the returns interface will reject requests via v2 and only v3 will be supported.

It is created when items are shipped to the\n  customer. Each item or service is invoiced exactly once. So that there can be more than one receipt per order.\n  Shipping costs are charged only once per partner and order and are shown only once in case of partial shipments of an\n  order.\n  Surcharges levied by a payment provider on the customer when using special payment conditions are not part of the\n  receipts of OTTO Market.\n- **REFUND**</br>\n  We distinguish different types of reimbursement documents. A refund receipt documents the a customer's claim of\n  reimbursement.\n  This receipt is currently created when returned items are accepted. A refund receipt normally contains at least an\n  item or service. In very rare cases, however, refund receipts can also be created in context of the cancellation\n  process to repay shipping costs only billed for full returns.\n  Earlier partial refunds are taken into account.\n- **PARTIAL_REFUND** </br>\n  We distinguish different types of reimbursement documents. A partial refund receipt documents a customer's claim of\n  reimbursement.\n  Different reasons are possible for partner to trigger such a receipt. For example a partial refund of an item price as\n  a gesture of goodwill to avoid returns\n\nOn all documents you will usually find\n\n- item/service details\n- shipped quantities\n- delivery costs\n- payment details\n- customer details\n- partner details\n\nSome details can only be found on the pdf documents. These include for example:\n\n- Company logo of OTTO (as operator of OTTO Market)\n- Company details of financial service providers\n- Contact details of OTTO (as relation center operator for customer inquiries and complaints)\n\nGeneral information:\n\n- Pdf documents are only generated once and do not change over time.\n- When a pdf is generated, dates are printed on the pdf documents in format DD.MM.YYYY in time zone (CET/CEST) from\n  Germany.\n- Currently, we provide receipts that are up to 4 years old. We could not guarantee this forever, so it would be good,\n  if you plan to get receipts always periodically.\n\nBelow you find the end points which can use to retrieve this information from the Receipts API.\n\n### Interested in some more details?\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Rough class diagram of JSON representation of receipt (Click to Expand)</b></mark>\n</summary>\n<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 18px;\">⚠</span>  This class diagram only shows the main objects to show the general structure.
