    * @tag item_summary
    * @param array $query
    *      - *aspect_filter* - string - optional
    *          - This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. <br><br>For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt.<br><br><code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red}</code> <br><br>To get a list of the aspect pairs and the category, which is returned in the <b>dominantCategoryId</b> field, set <b>fieldgroups</b> to <code>ASPECT_REFINEMENTS</code>.   <br><br> <code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS</code> <br><br><span class="tablenote"><b> Note:</b> The pipe symbol is used as a delimiter between aspect filter values. If a value contains a pipe symbol (for example, the brand name 'Bed|Stü'), you must enter a backslash before the pipe character to prevent it from being evaluated as a delimiter. <br><br>The following example shows the correct format for entering two brand names as aspect filter values, one of which contains a pipe symbol:<br><br><code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?limit=50&category_ids=3034&filter=buyingOptions:{AUCTION|FIXED_PRICE}&aspect_filter=categoryId:3034,Brand:{Bed&bsol;|Stü|Nike}</code></span><br><br><b>Required:</b> The category ID is required <i>twice</i>; once as a URI parameter and as part of the <b> aspect_filter</b>.

This gives you additional control over the result set. <br><br>For example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for "phone", the result set will be mobile phones because this is the "Best Match" for this search. But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted. <br><br><b> For example: </b><br><code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&category_ids=220</code><br> <br>The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: <ul> <li>Use the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/sellerinformation/news/categorychanges.html " target="_blank">Category Changes page</a>.</li> <li>Use the Taxonomy API. For details see <a href="/api-docs/buy/buy-categories.html">Get Categories for Buy APIs</a>. </li>  <li>Submit the following method to get the <b> dominantCategoryId</b> for an item. <br><br><code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=<em> keyword</em>&fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS  </code></li></ul>  <span class="tablenote"> <b> Note:</b> If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you <b> must</b> also include the <b> q</b> query parameter.</span> <br><br><b> Required: </b> The method must have <b> category_ids</b>, <b> epid</b>, <b> gtin</b>, or <b> q</b>  (or any combination of these)
    *      - *charity_ids* - string - optional
    *          - The charity ID is used to limit the results to only items associated with the specified charity. This field can have one charity ID or a comma separated list of IDs. The method will return all the items associated with the specified charities.<br><br> <b>For example:</b><br><code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?charity_ids=13-1788491,300108469</code><br><br>The charity ID is the charity's registration ID, also known as the Employer Identification Number (EIN). In GB, it is the Charity Registration Number (CRN), commonly called "Charity Number".   <ul><li>To find the charities eBay supports, you can search for a charity at <a href="https://charity.ebay.com/search " target="_blank">Charity Search </a> or go to <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Charity/bn_7114598164 " target="_blank">Charity Shop</a>.</li>   <li>To find the charity ID of a specific charity, click on a charity and use the EIN number. For example, the charity ID for  <a href="https://charity.ebay.com/charity/American-Red-Cross/3843 " target="_blank">American Red Cross</a>, is <code>530196605</code>.</li></ul> You  can also use any combination of the <code>category_Ids</code> and <code>q</code> fields with a <code>charity_Ids</code> to filter the result set.

    * @description This method checks if a product is compatible with the specified item. You can use this method to check the compatibility of cars, trucks, and motorcycles with a specific part listed on eBay. <br><br>For example, to check the compatibility of a part, you pass in the item ID of the part as a URI parameter and specify all the attributes used to define a specific car in the <b> compatibilityProperties</b> container. If the call is successful, the response will be <b> COMPATIBLE</b>, <b> NOT_COMPATIBLE</b>, or <b> UNDETERMINED</b>. See <a href="/api-docs/buy/browse/resources/item/methods/checkCompatibility#response.compatibilityStatus">compatibilityStatus</a> for details.   <br><br> <span class="tablenote"><b> Note: </b> The only products supported are cars, trucks, and motorcycles. </span><p>  To find the attributes and values for a specific marketplace, you can use the compatibility methods in the <a href="/api-docs/commerce/taxonomy/resources/methods">Taxonomy API</a>. You can use this data to create menus to help buyers specify the product, such as their car.</p> <p> For more details and a list of the required attributes for the US marketplace that describe motor vehicles, see <a href="/api-docs/buy/static/api-browse.html#Check">Check compatibility</a> in the Buy Integration Guide</a>.</p>   <p>For an example, see the <a href="/api-docs/buy/browse/resources/item/methods/checkCompatibility#h2-samples">Samples</a> section. </p><p><span class="tablenote"><b> Note: </b> This method is supported in Sandbox, but only when using the specific Item ID and compatibility name-value pairs called out in <a href="/api-docs/buy/browse/resources/item/methods/checkCompatibility#s0-1-22-6-7-7-6-SandboxSample-1">Sample 2</a>.</span></p><h3><b> Restrictions </b></h3> <p>For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see <a href="/api-docs/buy/browse/overview.html#API">API Restrictions</a>.</p> 
    * @tag item
    * @param string $itemId The eBay RESTful identifier of an item (such as a part you want to check). This ID is returned by the <b> Browse</b> and <b> Feed</b> API methods.  <br><br> <b> RESTful Item ID Format: </b><code>v1</code>|<code><i>#</i></code>|<code><i>#</i></code> <br>For example: <code>v1|2**********2|0</code> or <code>v1|1**********2|4**********2</code> <br><br>For more information about item ID for RESTful APIs, see the <a href="/api-docs/buy/static/api-browse.html#Legacy">Legacy API compatibility</a> section of the <i>Buy APIs Overview</i>.
    * @param array $data 
    *      - *compatibilityProperties* - array
    *          - An array of attribute name/value pairs used to define a specific product. For example: If you wanted to specify a specific car, one of the name/value pairs would be <br><code>"name" : "Year", <br>"value" : "2019"</code>  <p> For a list of the attributes required for cars and trucks and motorcycles see <a href="/api-docs/buy/static/api-browse.html#Check">Check compatibility</a> in the Buy Integration Guide.</p>
    * @return array
    *      - *compatibilityStatus* - string
    *          - An enumeration value that tells you if the item is compatible with the product. <br><br>The values are: <ul>   <li>   <b> COMPATIBLE</b> - Indicates the item is compatible with the product specified in the request.</li>   <li>   <b> NOT_COMPATIBLE</b> - Indicates the item is not compatible with the product specified in the request. Be sure to check all the <b> value</b> fields to ensure they are correct as errors in the value can also cause this response.</li>   <li> <b> UNDETERMINED</b> - Indicates one or more attributes for the specified product are missing so compatibility cannot be determined.  The response returns the attributes that are missing.</li>  </ul>  Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
