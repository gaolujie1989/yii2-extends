This operation is available for scheduled and unscheduled orders based on marketplace support. See **Get Time Slots** in the [Marketplace Support Table](doc:easyship-api-v2022-03-23-use-case-guide#marketplace-support-table).

This operation can return time slots that have either pickup or drop-off handover methods - see **Supported Handover Methods** in the [Marketplace Support Table](doc:easyship-api-v2022-03-23-use-case-guide#marketplace-support-table).

The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here.

This operation does the following:

*  Specifies the time slot and handover method for the order to be scheduled for delivery.

* Updates the Easy Ship order status.

* Generates a shipping label and an invoice. Calling `createScheduledPackage` also generates a warranty document if you specify a `SerialNumber` value. To get these documents, see [How to get invoice, shipping label, and warranty documents](doc:easyship-api-v2022-03-23-use-case-guide).

* Shows the status of Easy Ship orders when you call the `getOrders` operation of the Selling Partner API for Orders and examine the `EasyShipShipmentStatus` property in the response body.

See the **Shipping Label**, **Invoice**, and **Warranty** columns in the [Marketplace Support Table](doc:easyship-api-v2022-03-23-use-case-guide#marketplace-support-table) to see which documents are supported in each marketplace.

For more information, refer to the [marketplace support table](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/easyship-api-v2022-03-23-use-case-guide#marketplace-support-table).

You can optionally assign a `packageDetails` object to input a preferred time slot for each order in your request. In such cases, Amazon schedules the respective packages using the specified optional settings. If you don't specify a time slot, Amazon assigns the earliest available time slot. 

You can choose PDF or ZPL for your shipping label's file format and Amazon creates the label accordingly.

This operation returns an array that contains the scheduled packages, and a temporary URL that you can use to access a ZIP file. The ZIP file includes the generated shipping labels and any other documents that are required for your marketplace. If an order can't be scheduled, Amazon adds the `rejectedOrders` list in the response. The response contains an entry for each order that could not be processed. Each entry contains an error message that describes the reason for the failure.

The following table contains the supported request and burst maximum rates:
