This section describes how to obtain an access token using the password grant type.\n\n#### Requesting an Access Token\nTo request an access token, send a POST request to the /token endpoint of the Otto Market API with the following parameters:\n\n* <b>username</b>: Your API user account username.\n* <b>password</b>: Your API user account password. Make sure to URL-encode any special characters.\n* <b>grant_type</b>: Set to \"password\" to indicate that you're using the password grant type to obtain an access token.\n* <b>client_id</b>: Identifies your application to the API. Set to \"token-otto-api\".\n\nFor example, you can use the following cURL command to retrieve your access token:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\nhttps://api.otto.market/v1/token \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\\n-d 'username=<YourUsername>&password=<YourPassword>&grant_type=password&client_id=token-otto-api'\n```\n\nNote that you need to include your own username and password in the cURL command and URL-encode any special characters. For example, if your password is \"my!@password\", you would include it in the command above as \"my%21%40password\".\n\nAlternatively, you can let cURL encode the POST data by using --data-urlencode instead:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\\n  --data-urlencode username=<YourUsername> \\\n  --data-urlencode password=<YourPassword> \\\n  --data-urlencode grant_type=password \\\n  --data-urlencode client_id=token-otto-api\n\n```\n#### Response\n\nIf your request is successful, the API server responds with an access token in a JSON object that looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiISNCXIgiLCJSZWNla[...omitted for brevity...]\",\n  \"expires_in\": 1800,\n  \"refresh_expires_in\": 7200,\n  \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOO[...omitted for brevity...]\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"not-before-policy\": 0,\n  \"session_state\": \"3e0710b2-b57a-4cb0-a51d-6de60a997356\",\n  \"scope\": \"pumba-roles-app-portal partner email profile\"\n}\n```\n\nThe <b>\"access_token\"</b> property contains the access token that you can use to authenticate subsequent requests to the Otto Market API. Make sure to include the access token in the Authorization header of your API requests, using the Bearer token type.\n\n\n### Example\nHere's an example cURL command that retrieves a list of products from the Otto Market API, using the access token obtained in the previous step:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\\nhttps://api.otto.market/v2/products \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' \\\n-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache'\n```\nThis cURL command sends a GET request to the /v2/products endpoint of the Otto Market API, with the Authorization header set to the access token obtained in the previous step. The -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' option is included to ensure that the server doesn't return a cached response.\n\n#### Best-practice when renewing a token\n\nUse available tokens as long as possible before fetching a new `access_token`. In general new access_tokens should be fetched by using\nthe `refresh_token`. Expiration date of an access token is indicated by the attribute `expires_in` for access_tokens\nand `refresh_expires_in` for refresh_tokens. Please bear in mind that a refresh token can only be used once.\nIn other words, once a refresh token is used to obtain a new access token, then the same refresh token cannot be reused even if it has not yet expired.\n\n\n### Use refresh token\nA single refresh token can only be used to obtain a new access token, if\n\n1) The refresh token has not expired, and\n2) The refresh token has not been used before.\n\nThe refresh token can be extracted from the <code\nclass=\"inline\">refresh_token</code> value.\nOnce the access token has expired or is going to be expired, you should use the refresh token to get a new\naccess token, without using your users credentials again. You can use the\nfollowing cURL command. Include the refresh token (without leading and trailing < >).\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\\n  -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>&grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=token-otto-api'\n```\n\nThe response of this request will look like the example above, the access token\ncan be extracted from <code class=\"inline\">access_token</code> and the new\nrefresh token from <code class=\"inline\">refresh_token</code>.\n\n## API Access for Partner cooperating with a Service Provider\n`Note:` *This feature is not available for all partners. If you want access, create a support ticket for the category [Technische Schnittstellen](https://portal.otto.market)*\n\nIf you are cooperating with a Service Provider you will get a link for installing an app of this Service Provider. In order to do so follow the steps below:\n1. Login to [OTTO Partner Connect (OPC)](https://portal.otto.market) portal.\n2. Click on the link you got from the Service Provider (either directly or from e.g. the homepage of this Service Provider).\n3. You will be asked to grant consent that the app is allowed to access the scopes displayed in the consent screen (e.g., products or orders).\n   If you don't grant consent nothing will happen. The app won't be installed and thus won't be able to access your data.\n   `Note:` *In order to install the app you have to grant access to all the specified scopes. Allowing only a part of them is not possible.*\n4. If you grant consent the app is \"installed\" and you can use it. It is now also displayed in the installed apps tab (\"Installierte Apps\") on the [service provider page (\"Dienstleister\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Dienstleister)\n\n### Revoke Consent\n\nIf you want to revoke your consent you can do so by navigating to the overview of your installed apps (\"Installierte Apps\") on the [service provider page (\"Dienstleister\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Dienstleister). Hover over the app name to get the Button for revoking consent (\"Zugriff entziehen\"). When clicking on this button you get a popup window asking you to confirm that you want to revoke your consent. If you do so, the app gets uninstalled meaning it has no longer access to your data and you cannot use it any longer. Of course, you can re-install the app if you want to.\n\n## API Access for Service Providers\nRefer [Developer Program](/docs#section/Developer-Program) section below for more details about authentication and authorization. Once you have authentication and authorization,\nread further for the next steps.\n\n## Calling an Endpoint\nAll endpoints are secured via authorization. You add the HTTP <code class=\"inline\">Authorization</code>\n-Header with value <code class=\"inline\">Bearer ey...</code> and will get access.\n```\ncurl -X GET \\\n  https://api.otto.market/v2/orders \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5jdhstdheSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICI4T1d6MjhuZ01GbHBURDl5TGtxQkRHMThuYXZNVFgyTWtqNVhkY0RITDBZIn0.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.SleUexNdapaY5RmrVTbKRMiVpRrbNLjIUi7fILsW1hkpqQbX4IQRaSufSt98Ar0OkEmIvZvYPpGVecmjwYvD3YQzBmlcdU0V544Y0h8y01RyxZAYGZbRXfA1kOsFDucnrClCcj1JIaQMU4629wU9OM_SdQaLvfTA2l5prma94RekdWR3S-6DzXqJDtHrrcYS8BsfohkuLdi1U8vPUjwee9lsY3RTa9YZVekH4hFVWMl0Pbwub8jwum6zRjTu-ZAiLhZSnl8mSaMtrJFmkzRi3-s9eN7k0lnLKWGt7JuqZ_vbiJT8ZhHvPur4eLrY02ehF6-lwSUyjWMCzCi5TjBgYg'\n```\n\nThe expected result has an HTTP 200 code with a probably empty list.\n\n## Rate Limiting\nA high volume of calls on API services at any given time would increase server resource consumption. If the load is due to an unauthorized intrusion it would be a chaos. Thus, rate limiting becomes extremely important.\n\nIn general authenticated API calls are limited for each partner to 20 requests per second.\nExceeding the rate limit results in a HTTP 429 \"too many requests\" error.\nFor some endpoints the rate limit is lower to ensure the best quality for all API users. Please see below:\n\n|Endpoint path|HTTP method|Max requests per time unit|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|/products|GET|10 per second|\n|/products|POST|20 per second|\n|/products/active-status|GET|10 per second|\n|/products/active-status|POST|3600 per day|\n|/products/marketplace-status|GET|10 per second|\n|/products/categories|GET|10 per second|\n|/products/brands|GET|10 per second|\n|/v1/token|POST|10 per second for each IP|\n|other endpoints|POST & GET|20 per second|\n\n### User Based API Throttling\nA general method of limiting usage of API resource is to allocate a pre-configured static or dynamic quota for a consumer. The API rate limiting is done on the basis of partner-id. A particular partner-id can make 20 requests per second.\n\n### Best Practice\nPlease divide your requests over the day and avoid sending all data at once. Make use of the individual limits for the interfaces. This helps preventing our systems from clogging and ensures a flawless experience for everyone.\n\n## Timeouts and Defaults\n| Name            | Value | Description                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| request timeout | 10s   | The maximum HTTP request timeout for all interfaces                                                             |\n| limit           | 128   | The default for limit query parameter. See Paging. The default limit can be overwritten in specific interfaces. |\n\n## Common Patterns\n### Interface Definition\nOur REST interface definitions are basically using swagger.io.\nAll interface definitions can be automatically used by you to generate necessary API objects and similar in\nyour chosen implementation language.\nIn order to remain technically extensible and up-to-date, individual interfaces may have been\ndescribed in new or different definition schemes. We are constantly trying to keep all interfaces\ntechnically up to date.\n\n### Versioning\nThe OTTO Market API uses different versions for the single endpoints. The version number is included in the URL path.\n[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme is used, but only the major version. Breaking changes are only introduced in new major versions. API version is required in all urls.\n\nEndpoints may introduce new optional fields at any time in the request and any new fields in the response. The client must skip all unknown fields.\n\nFor every endpoint, a changelog exists which displays the latest released changes and the upcoming unreleased changes. Additionally, an overall [Changelog](/) exists with the most exciting changes about the API in general.\n\n### Supporting old versions\nThe OTTO Partner API continues to support old versions of an API for **6 months** from the time of public announcement for the new version of a given API.\nIt is recommanded to check regularly. This can be be automated by checking HTTP headers for the attribute `SunsetHeader`, which indicates when versions go offline.\n\n#### Best-practice\nRegurlarly check for the `SunsetHeader` and act as soon as the attribute appears by updating your integration to the new version within the presented time frame.\n\n__example:__\n```\nWarning: v2 is deprecated. Please migrate to v3\nSunset: Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT\nDeprecation: Wed, 11 Nov 2018 23:59:59 GMT\nLink: <https://api.otto.market/v3/orders>; rel=\"successor-version\"\n```\n\n## Header\nSome common headers should be set by clients:\n\n1. Set the <code class=\"inline\">X-Request-Timestamp</code> header according to the [ISO-8601](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) standard. You can use this regex pattern: <code class=\"inline\">^\\d{4}-(0\\d|1[0-2])-([0-2]\\d|3[01])T(2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d:[0-5]\\d(\\.\\d+)?(\\[+-](2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d|Z)$</code>\n2. Set <code class=\"inline\">Accept</code> to the desired response format e.g. <code class=\"inline\">application/json</code>\n3. Set the <code class=\"inline\">Content-Type</code> header to define the used format in the request body, only applicable if you send a request body\n\n## HTTP Methods\nThe interfaces describe which HTTP methods are allowed and how to use them.\nOur basic concern is that basically all HTTP Methods are allowed in the [standardized way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).\nNote that these methods should behave as specified by their\n[standardized meaning (idempotency)](http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/idempotency/).\nThe following is a description of a few special features, relevant facts or ways to use some of the HTTP methods.\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand for details</summary>\n\n### POST\nPOST will update specific fields **and** returns the result like a GET would do (error response is independent).\n\n### PUT\nPUT will create or replace the whole entity independent of an existing entity.\n\n### PATCH\nPATCH will update specific fields **and** not return data like a GET would do (error response is independent).\nPATCH body is structured in the same way as PUT and POST (entity body).\nAll fields added into your body will be updated, other fields will not be affected.\n\n__example:__\n```\n{\n  \"username\" : \"myusername\",\n  \"email\" : null\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\nWe are using [standardized HTTP status code](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)\nwith a body only if needed (it also just can be empty), but details about that you can find at the\nconcrete interface implementation.\n\n| Verb   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| HEAD   | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| GET    | Used for retrieving resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| POST   | Used for creating resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| PATCH  | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data.

Please pay attention to the response pattern to identify how to handle lists. There are two common ways list handling is implemented. One way to retrieve the next entry of a list is by using links for navigation the entries. The other is by providing list pages to iterate through lists.\n\nFor pagination, the basic query parameter \"limit\" (e.g. <code class=\"inline\">?limit=10</code>) can be used to define the maximum amount of resulting entities returned per call. The interface itself can reduce the limit lower than your client limit.\n\nAn example entity using links (not pages) to navigate would be:\n```\n{\n  resources: [\n    {\n      ...data of the entity if all or some information will be provided directly...,\n      links: [\n        {\n          href: \"/v1/orders/1234\",  <--- Link to single partner order\n          rel: \"self\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  links: [\n    {\n      href: \"/v1/orders?idGt=1234\", <--- Link to next list of ressources. If not present, no more records exist, currently\n      rel: \"next\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Bulk requests\nAttention: When sending bulk requests to any /products API endpoint, it will be processed asynchronously at the backend.\n\n### Synchronous Answer\nSynchronously will be delivered an endpoint to check the asynchronous processing state.\n```\nHTTP STATUS 202 (Accepted)\n{\n    \"task\": {\n        \"href\": \"/interface/foo/123\",\n        \"id\": \"123\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Check the State of an Endpoint\nThe client can follow the <code class=\"inline\">href</code> to check the state of processing.\n\n#### Best-practice:\nAs long as the `state = pending` the attribute `pingAfter` dictates when to send a new request.\n\nAn example entity would be:\n```\n{\n  \"state\": \"pending\",\n  \"message\": \"is running boy\",\n  \"progress\": \"35\",\n  \"total\": \"100\",\n  \"pingAfter\": \"2019-05-01T13:25:12+0200\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"self\",\n      \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"failed\",\n      \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/failed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"succeeded\",\n      \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/succeeded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Fetching files like PDF and CSV\n\nClients don't have to know the filetype that will be returned from a resource.\nResources serving files will have the appropriate file extension in the URL as shown in the example below.\n\n**Request Headers**\n```\nGET /SomeInvoice.pdf HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\n```\n\nClients can find out the mime-type from the Content-Type header that will be sent in the response (e.g. application/pdf for PDF files and application/csv for CSV files).\n\n**Response Headers**\n\n  ```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 514493\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n```\n\n## Common fields\nCommon fields like time, currency, country codes etc need to follow the standard ISO guidelines unless mentioned otherwise. The fields must report the format they are following on the docs.\n\n### Some standard formats:\n- Time: Accept in any time zone in ISO-8601 format and always reply in UTC.\n\n  Example: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `hh:mm:ss.sss`: `2020-03-12` and `22:33:34.400`\n- Currency: ISO-4217.\n\n  Example: `EUR` for Euros, `GBP` for British Pound Sterling.\n- Country code: ISO-3166-1 alpha-3\n\n  Example: `DEU` for Germany, `NOR` for Norway.\n\n# Use-Cases\n\n## How to list your first product\n\n*This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you list your first product on the OTTO Market.\nYou´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*\n\nTo list a product you´ll have to do the following:\n\n1. Authenticate\n2. Read valid brands\n3. Read valid categories\n4. Post product\n5. Check update-tasks\n6. Check marketplace status\n7. Update quantities\n\n### Authenticate\nAt first you have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)\n\n### Read valid brands\nNext you have to read the valid brands and find your relevant brand. You can only sell brands where the attribute \"usable\" = true. If you cannot find your brand, you have to create a new one by following the brand creation process in the OTTO Partner Connect Portal. \nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getBrands\n\n### Read valid categories\nFollowing that you´ll need to read the valid categories to know which category to list your products in. \nYou are also be able to read from the list which attributes are mandatory (fe when listing in a specific category and which attribute is relevant for increasing the visibility of a product. Here you have to look after **relevance** and **featureRelevance** to get more information about customer relevance the usage of the attribute on otto.de. All attributes with the **featureRelevance=LEGAL** are mandatory for creating a product. \nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getCategoryGroups\n\n### Post product\nWhen you´ve gathered a valid brand and category, know which attributes you want to add and now it´s finally time to post your first product.\nBy reading the documentation mentioned below you´ll learn which values (e.g. EAN, SKU, productDescription, ...) are required.\nPlease note that the title on otto.de is created by OTTO using your information in the product data. The title is composed of individual fields such as \"category\", \"brandId\", \"productLine\"... The structure can be different for each category. An info about the structure you get also in the category list in the field \"title\".\nYou´ll also find an example request for create or update product variants on this page.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__createOrUpdateProductVariations\n\n### Check update-tasks\nIf you´ve posted your product from the step before, you´ll reveice an http 202 with different links in the response. In the next step you have to check for errors by addressing the \"Update-Tasks\". \nTo get further information you have to proceed a get request with the \"self\" link. When the process state changed from \"pending\" to \"done\", you can fetch further information with the \"failed\", \"succeeded\" or \"unchanged\" link. In the response of the \"self\" link you also can see how much SKU can be found under which link. If there were errors you´ll have to solve these and post your updated product listing again.\nDon´t forget to check the update-tasks another time before carrying on.\n**Attention!** Posting the exact same data a second time is a bad idea since our server is configured to ignore duplicate listings. If a product data would have been ignored, you´ll find the information within the \"unchanged\" link.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__progressByProcessId\n\n### Check marketplace status\nLast validation step for your product is to check the marketplace status of your SKU.\nThrough Update-Tasks you´ll see if there are technical errors you´ll have to solve. In the marketplace status you´ll see if there are non-technical errors you´ll have to solve. As well the \"moin\" will be shown in the marketplace status at first. We recommend to fetch the marketplace status for each SKU as a list with the parameter \"fromDate\" in a regularer basis to see \"errors\" and get the current \"moin\". \nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatus\n\n### Update quantities\nLastly you´ll have to set the quantities of your product so customers can finally see and buy your product. To reduce error messages, just sent over quantities for SKU wherefore you have gotten a \"moin\" via the marketplace status.\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Quantities-V2/operation/Quantities-V2__storeAvailableQuantitiesUsingPOST\n\n**Congratulations!** You´ve successfully listed your first product on the OTTO Market.\nThe next step is to regularly check for new orders. In the following case you can learn all about the order process and what you have to know about some specifics. [Click here to learn how to do that.](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases/Manage-an-order-from-start-to-finish)\n\n## Manage an order from start to finish\n\n*This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you fulfilling your first order including subsequent activities on the OTTO Market.\nYou´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*\n\nTo fulfill your first order and manage subsequent activities you´ll have to do the following:\n\n1. Authenticate\n2. Regularly check for new orders\n3. Report order as shipped\n4. Fetch purchase receipt\n5. Regularly screen for return announcements\n6. Process returns\n7. Fetch refund receipt\n\n### Authenticate\nYou´ll have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)\n\n### Regularly check for new orders\nNext you´ll have to regurlarly check for new orders to fulfill. We recommend checking several times a day.\nYou´ll find the different fulfillment states orders can have, their descriptions and common use-cases listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4). We also recommend to fetch orders in the **state=ANNOUNCED** for the reservation of quantity on your end. After the order switched to the **state=PROCESSABLE** (usually after 35 Minutes except for the paymentMethod=prepayment) the customer information will be visible in the order.\nTo carry on with fulfilling your first order the state has to be = PROCESSABLE. \nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4/operation/Orders-V4__findPartnerOrders\n\n### Report order as shipped\nPackaging the ordered items is next before you can hand them to your carrier and mark the order as shipped.\nWe´ll call it a shipment from this point onward. Every shipment needs a **tracking key** and unless it´s a forwarder shipment you´ll also have to provide a **returnTrackingKey** upfront. If a returnTrackingKey is mandatory for a shipment is dependent on the deliveryType of the sku needed to fulfill in the shipment. You can manage the deliveryType for each sku within the productdata update process. \nPlease read the following endpoint for all technical information:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1/operation/Shipments-V1__createdAndSentShipmentUsingPOST\n\nIf you want to fulfill a sku with more than one package, you´ll need to split the shipment and use [this endpoint](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1/operation/Shipments-V1__createdAndSentMultiparcelShipmentUsingPOST).\n\n### Fetch purchase receipt\nAfter the shipment was successfully created, a purchase receipts will be created on our end. These receipt will be shown to the customer in ther customer account. You can get the purchase receipt by using the receipts endpoint with the **receiptTypes=PURCHASE** as JSON. You also can fetch the receipt as PDF by using the **receiptNumber**. We recommend to use the parameter **receiptTypes** and the parameter **from** and **to**. You also can fetch receipts specifically for one order by using the parameter **salesOrderId**. For further information have a look in the description of the receipts api listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3)\nPlease read the following endpoint for all technical information:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3/operation/Receipts-V3__getReceiptsUsingGET_5\n\n### Regularly screen for return announcements\nCustomers may want to return their order wholly or partially. Return labels will be created through their customer interface and the return status will change to announced. The status misdirected is also displayed to inform you that a customer has mistakenly returned the product to otto. It is recommended to regularly check for announced and misdirected returns using the following endpoint:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2/operation/Returns-V2__getPositionItemsForUsingGETV2\n\n### Process returns\nReceived returns have to be checked by your warehouse and either accepted or rejected depending on the condition of the return.\nAccepting a return will lead to a customer repayment. You can accept returns using this endpoint:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2/operation/Returns-V2__receiveAcceptedReturnsV2UsingPOSTV2\n\nIf the condition of the return is unacceptable you´re able to reject the return. If you do so you have to submit a reason for the rejection:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2/operation/Returns-V2__receiveRejectedReturnsV2UsingPOSTV2\n\n### Fetch refund receipt\nAfter the return was successfully created, a refund receipts will be created on our end. These receipt will be also shown to the customer in ther customer account. You can get the refund receipt by using the receipts endpoint with the **receiptTypes=REFUND** as JSON. Our recommendations in fetching the return receipts are same as they are in fetching the purchase receipt. Use different parameter to filter your request and get your relevant information. For further information have a look in the description of the receipts api listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3)\nPlease read the following endpoint for all technical information:\nhttps://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3/operation/Receipts-V3__getReceiptsUsingGET_5\n\n**Congratulation!**\nYou´ve successfully gone through the whole order processing process on the OTTO Market. You should know which request are necessary for you and which specifics you have to note. \nIn the next step, we want to give you more information about after-sales processes. [Click here to learn how to do that.](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases/Manage-your-after-sales-actions)\n\n# Sandbox\n\n### General\n**Sandbox is the test environment,**\nused for testing an API connection. It provides all the functionalities of the live OTTO Market Interface. All actions and orders there are simulated for testing purposes.\n\nThe login session and the API key in the sandbox environment are completely separated from the production environment.\n\nREST API: **https://sandbox.api.otto.market**\n\n## Getting started\nFollow these steps to start testing on our sandbox environment:\n\n1.  Make yourself familiar with sandbox functionalities.\n2.  Request a sandbox API user:\n    As a **partner (seller)** the fastest way is to open a new ticket in [OTTO Partner Connect](https://account.otto.market/s/ticketanlegen) through the Partner Helpdesk choosing the sub-category \"Technische Schnittstellen\".\n    As a **service provider** please register in our [OTTO Market Developer Program](https://developer.otto.market/).\n\n3.  Authenticate to our sandbox environment. See [DevelopersGuide](/docs#section/Partner-API-Developer's-Guide) for further information.\n4.  Use our Order generator to create fictional orders. See Technical Advice below to know, which orders are created.\n5.  Test the API functionality of your application.\n\n## Technical Advice\nPlease note the following information:\n### Authorization\nFor the endpoint like all the other endpoints a valid authorization token has to\nbe sent. If you need further information, please consult the [Developers\nGuide](/docs#section/Partner-API-Developer's-Guide).\n\n### GET-Returns Endpoint\nSince there are no real costumers, returns cannot be announced. Hence, the GET endpoint of returns is retrieving an empty string.\n\n### Sandbox Reset\nTo prevent data overload, our sandbox and its orders are reset monthly at first Sunday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.\\\nAny dynamic data (shipments, returns) is deleted. Old shipments will not be available anymore.\\\nTherefore, you have to create new orders every month.\n\n### Order Generator\nTo test your API implementation you can generate test orders only on the sandbox environment by sending an empty POST request to the following generation endpoint:\n\n[https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders]()\n\nThis will run 8 predefined scenarios on our sandbox. After the POST request, you will receive 6 orders in \"PROCESSABLE\" status with different combinations of positions and items (e.g. standard and freight delivery). You will also receive 1 prepayment order in \"ANNOUNCED\" and 1 order in \"CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE\" status.\n\nThe generated orders will contain one or more position items with the following products:\n\n| Product Title                       | EAN           | SKU                   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Smartphone »CallMe 1000«            | 1245780164732 | SmartCM1000-schwarz-1 |\n| Fancy Shirt »Flower«                | 4851278936452 | FancyFlower-m-pi      |\n| Rasenmaeher »Turbo V1«              | 9821393948573 | 0440-Rasen-T-V1       |\n| Spedition Wohnlandschaft 3.tlg.     | 8263748321943 | Sped-Wohn-3-98735     |\n| Spedition Kühlschrank »COOL EXTREM« | 7263000981290 | Sped-Kühl084-kombi    |\n\nScenarios:\n\n| Scenarios        | Status                   | Comment                                                                                                              |\n|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 | PROCESSABLE              | Scenario 4 inclusive discount                                                                                        |\n| 5                | ANNOUNCED                | Order with payment method PREPAYMENT awaiting customer's payment<br>Order includes weeePickup on position item level |\n| 6                | CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE | Order with payment method PREPAYMENT which has been cancelled since the customer didn't pay                          |\n\nPlease use the generated orders to test the interaction with Orders, Shipments and Returns.\n\nIf you want to create a single scenario you can do that by sending an empty POST to:\n\n[https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario\\{scenarionumber\\}]()\n\ne.g. [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario1]()\n\n## Best-practice test cases\n\nWe´ve come up with mulitple test cases to help you test the basic functionalities needed for each endpoint when offering your service to an OTTO Market Seller.\nThe test cases should be tested within the sandbox environment. If you´re interested in feedback from our service provider management you can send screenshots of the test results [here](mailto:partnerintegration@otto.market?subject=[OTTO%20Market%20API]%20Service%20Provider%20test%20cases).\n\nWe´re referring to the test orders created using the *test order generator* within the sandbox environment. Please read the section [Order Generator](#order-generator) on how to create test orders.\n\n### Products\nWe want to test the successful and incorrect creation of several products as well as the deactivation of the\nproducts. The successful display of the errors and OTTO categories should also be tested.\n\n1. Download the valid category list over the appropriate endpoint and load it into your mapping interface.\n\n**Attention:** Please remember to show your customer the `featureRelevance` and `relevance` of attributes. `LEGAL` attributes are mandatory.\n\n2. Download the valid brand list over the appropriate endpoint and load it into your system.\n\n3. List a product with 8 SKUs of a valid brand and a valid category.\n\n4. Try listing a product with a wrong brand, a wrong category, an attribute with a wrong name and a wrong value.\n\n5. Please deactivate a SKU from the product created in test case 1 and send us a screenshot of the deactivation display in your\n   system.\n6. To test all Go-Live processes please have a look at the following section and perform all three test cases shown to ensure the correct handling of the MOIN and the marketplace-status: [Products:-Validation-and-test-cases](#Products:-Validation-and-test-cases)\n\n### Quantities\nWe want to test the successful transfer of inventory to existing SKUs.\n\n7. Please send a positive inventory via the interface for three of the successfully submitted SKUs.\n\n**Attention:** Inventory updates should only be updated when the quanities have changed for a product. That being said a  common best practice is to atleast align the stock keeping system with the OTTO Market once a day. Maybe at night.\n\n### Orders\nWe want to test the processes for pulling orders in different statuses using self-generated test orders. The\ncancellation process is also to be tested.\n\n8. Generate the collection of 16 test orders (in 8 scenarios) via the order generator and pull the orders in the status \"PROCESSABLE\".\n\n9. GET the orders in the status \"ANNOUNCED\".\n\n10. Use one of the orders from test scenario 2 and cancel it via the corresponding interface.\n\n11. Use one of the orders from scenario 7 and simply cancel an item from the order using the appropriate interface.\n\n### Shipments\nWe want to test the shipping processes and consider the special feature of the returnTrackingKey for\nparcel shipping. Test cases for parcel shipping and forwarding shipping are to be executed.\n\n12. Use one of the orders from scenario 1 and report the items in a shipment as shipped.\n\n13. Use one of the orders from scenario 1 and report two different shipments (two package shipments) for the four items.\n\n14. Use one of the orders from scenario 3 and report the item as shipped in a shipment.\n\n15. Use one of the orders from scenario 8 and report all items in separate shipments as shipped (parcel shipping + freight\n    forwarding shipping)\n\n### Returns\nFinally, the return case should be checked and a return accepted and rejected for an item successfully\nmarked as shipped.\n\n16. Use the order marked as shipped from test case 10 and report the items as accepted returns (acceptance).\n\n17. Use the order marked as shipped from test case 12 and report the item as an unaccepted return (rejection).\n\n### Receipts\n\nAfter the successful shipment or return process a new receipt will be created. For each shipment you will find a purchase receipt and for each return accepted you can find a refund receipt.\n\n18. Use the order marked as shipped from testcase 12 and download the specific purchase receipt as a JSON with the salesOrderId as parameter.\n\n20. Use the order marked as returned from testcase 16 and download the specific refund receipt as a JSON with the salesOrderId as parameter.\n\n22. For partial_refund receipts you can either filter by using the salesOrderId as parameter (if you happen to know when exactly in which salesOrderId a partial_refund was set) or the parameter receiptTypes=”PARTIAL_REFUND” togehter with the parameters from=yyyy-mm-dd and to=yyyy-mm-dd to get all partial_refund receipts for a specific time frame.\n\n**Please note:** Partial_refund will be set after the customer complained and the seller want to grant a refund).\nMostly this process happens manually via the OTTO Partner Connect Portal but is also available via the API Price-Reductions)\n\n\n## Products: Validation and test cases\n\nWe want to test the successful and incorrect creation of several products as well as the deactivation of the products.\nThe successful display of product related errors, OTTO categories and brands should also be tested.\n\n### Validation\n\nSubmitted product data is validated in two steps:\n\n**1. Technical validation**\n\nThe first technical validation (syntax and required attributes) takes place after you´ve sent product data using a POST request.\nRead more about uploading products here: OTTO Market API: Create or update your product variations.\nIf your http request was successful (http response state 200), you´ll be provided with four different links (pending, succeeded, failed, unchanged).\nFollowing the links you´ll be able to check which products have been successfully listed, failed, unchanged or are still being processed.\n\n|Status|Explanation|\n|:-|:-|\n|Pending|The product listing is still being processed|\n|Succeeded|The shown products listing was successful|\n|Failed|Listing of all shown products has failed|\n|Unchanged|The request for the listed products is unchanged to the last request|\n\n**2. Shop validation**\n\nThe second step is the shop validation. Results of the shop validation are retrievable using the marketplace-status endpoint.\nPlease read OTTO Market API: Read the marketplace status on how to use the marketplace status endpoint.\nSubmitted product data always has one of the following four marketplace statuses:\n\n| Status     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pending    | Submitted product data is currently proceeded.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Online     | The SKU is displayed at otto.de. You can find the SKU using the shop link. <br />In some cases, additional information will be shown on how to improve the visibility on otto.de. |\n| Restricted | The SKU is not displayed at otto.de because of an error shown within the error’s container.                                                                                       |\n| Inactive   | The SKU was set inactive via the active-status endpoint and could be reactivated via the active-status endpoint.                                                                  |\n\n**Attention:** Since the sandbox is missing a direct shop integration the second validation is simulated.\n\n### Test cases\n\nTo ensure you´re able to test every marketplace status including different errors we´ve added specific EAN´s to our sandbox environment.\nBelow you´ll find predefined test cases to simulate possible cases from the live environment.\nAs mentioned before the different states are retrievable fetching the marketplace status.\n\n**Test case #1: Status Online with poor data quality:**\n\nA product status can be online but still have poor data quality.\nTo increase the visibility please add the listed attributes from the error message (“{0}”).\n\nThis state can be tested by listing SKU´s using one or more of the following EAN´s:\n\n- “6250000000010”\n- “6250000000027”\n- “6250000000034”\n- “6250000000041”\n- “6250000000058”\n\nYou should receive an error message that looks anything like this:\n\n800001 - DATAQUALITY_NOTICE_SIGNIFICANT_ATTRIBUTE_AND_INFORMATION:\n“Durch die Pflege folgender Attribute kann die Sichtbarkeit des Produktes gesteigert werden: ''{0}''”\n\n**Test case #2: Status Restricted – Brand blocked**\n\nSome brands are reserved for specific sellers. By listing a product with one of those reserved brands you should receive the following error message:\n\n600007- BRAND_BLOCKED and error title: “Die Marke ist gesperrt und darf nicht eingespielt werden.“\nThis state can be tested by listing SKU´s using one or more of the following EAN´s:\n\n- “6250000000065”\n- “6250000000072”\n- “6250000000089”\n- “6250000000096”\n- “6250000000102”\n\n**Test case #3: Status Restricted – EAN already known**\n\nTo ensure a great customer experience, product listings using the same EAN are grouped on the OTTO market. This leads to seller competition.\nBy listing a product with a yet unknown EAN a new moin will be generated and must be included in all future updates / listings for that EAN.\nThe moin is retrievable via the marketplace status.\n\nBy listing a product with an already known EAN you´ll be prompted with the following error message:\n\n700001 - MOIN_ALREADY_KNOWN and the error title:\n“Diese Variante ist auf dem OTTO Marktplatz bereits bekannt. Um die Variante zum Verkauf anbieten zu können, bestätigen Sie uns bitte den Content,\nindem sie die MOIN beim nächsten Update an uns zurückschicken.“\n\nThe error message says that the EAN is already known and can only be sold by including the moin.\nThe moin is retrievable from the marketplace status. Including the moin means you´re agreeing that you´re selling the exact same product which has\ninitially generated the moin for the EAN you´re trying to sell. If you disagree, please contact support@otto.market.\n\nThe listing of a product with an already known EAN is possible by listing SKU´s using one or more of the following EAN´s:\n\n- “6250000000201”\n- “6250000000300”\n- “6250000000409”\n- “6250000000508”\n- “6250000000607”\n- “6250000000706”\n- “6250000000805”\n- “6250000000904”\n- “6250000001000”\n\n**Test case #4: Status Restricted – MOIN incorrect**\n\nIt´s possible that you´re trying to submit a product including the moin but the moin has a typo / is wrong in general.\nYou´ll receive the following error message then:\n\n700002 – MOIN_INCORRECT and the error title:\n“Die von Ihnen zu dieser Variante übertragene MOIN entspricht nicht der von uns für diese Variante vergebenen MOIN.\nBitte überprüfen Sie ihre Daten und korrigieren die MOIN entsprechend.“\n\nThis is solved by including the correct moin.\n\n\n# Developer Program\nThis section describes how a service provider can integrate with OTTO Market API.\nOur new developer program aims at equipping the service providers with authentication and authorization for accessing the OTTO Market API `on behalf of the partner`.\n\n## Target Group\nThe Developer Program is intended primarily for service providers who want to exchange data for OTTO Market Partners and offer their service to other sellers. OTTO Market Partners who would like to develop their own OTTO Market API connection use their own API user and can find more information here (link https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)).\n\n## Registration as Service Provider\nIf you want to register as a service provider who needs to access Partner data, please follow the steps at [developer.otto.market](https://developer.otto.market/register).\nYou'll receive email notifications for any approval / denial of registration requests.\n\nAfter submitting your registration and a first check, you will receive 30 days' access to the sandbox environment for getting to know the inferfaces and estimate your effort without completing the registration process.\nIf you decide to integrate, complete the registration by filling out the self-disclosure form. You will receive this at the end of the 30-day provisional access period.\n\nUpon successful registration, service provider will be created with private access which can later be changed by raising request in OPC.\n\nFor more information about the registration and integration process, please have a look at [developer.otto.market](https://developer.otto.market).\n\n## Private and Public Access for Service Provider\n\nOnce your registration was successful you have private access to the OTTO Partner Connect portal meaning you can create only private apps in Production environment. (Read more about the difference between private and public apps [here](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Private-and-Public-Apps).)\n\n### Getting Public Access\n\nIf you want to get public access follow the steps below:\n\n1. Login to OTTO Partner Connect portal and navigate to your [profile page (\"Dienstleisterprofil\")](https://portal.otto.market/profile/Dienstleisterprofil)\n2. Check the box at the very bottom stating that you want to get public access\n3. Click on save (\"Speichern\").\n4. Done! Your request will be reviewed by OTTO Market developer team. You'll receive email notifications for approval / denial of your request.\n\n*Please note: Once you have public access this cannot be reverted meaning you cannot request only private access!*\n\n## Private and Public Apps\n\n#### Private Apps\n\nPrivate apps can be created by private as well as public service providers. If a OTTO Market partner wants to install a private app, an unique app invitation link (\"Einladungslink\") is required.\n\n**Generate an app invitation link**\nYou can generate an unique app invitation link for an app by following the steps below:\n\n1. Login to the [OTTO Partner Connect](https://portal.otto.market/profile/Dienstleisterprofil) portal.\n2. Navigate to the [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) and [Sandbox Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/sp-sandbox-apps) page for production and sandbox apps respectively.\n3. Click on the three dots (…) right to the app name for which you want to create an invitation link.\n4. In the dropdown menu select \"Einladungslink generieren\".\n5. A popup window will be displayed. Copy the link from this window - it will not show up again.\n6. Done! You can now share the app invitation link with a OTTO Market partner.\n\n`Note:` You should be aware of the following:\n- After closing the popup window with the invitation link you won't be able to see this exact invitation link again.\n- You can create as much inviation links as you want to.\n- There is no possibility to show all invitation links created for a specific app.\n- Every app invitation link is only valid for 24 hours and can be used only once. (When it is used or expired the link will become invalid and you have to create a new one.)\n- If a partner clicks on the link but don't grant consent the link remains valid (until it is either expired or consent is granted).\n\n#### Public Apps\n\nPublic apps can only be created by public service providers. (For getting public access refer to [Getting Public Access](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Getting-Public-Access).)\nIn order to install a public app, an universally valid installation link (\"Installationslink\") is required. After creating a public app this link is displayed in the app details page. You can share this link whereever you want.\nYou can also add an optional parameter \"state\" to this installation link, which preserves the state of your application page and returns user back to that state after they install. If this optional parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with the optional state.\nBut be aware that it is universally valid meaning you cannot control which partner will install your app.\n#### Converting a private app into a public app\n\nOnly public service providers have the option to convert private apps into public ones. (For getting public access refer to [Getting Public Access](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Getting-Public-Access).)\n\n`Note:` BEFORE CONVERTING an app to public you should be aware of the following:\n- This action CANNOT be undone meaning you cannot convert a public app back to private.\n- This action has no effect on existing installations of your app. This means that every partner who has installed this app before (via an one-time use app invitation link) can still use it. (They don't need to re-install it or do anything.)\n- Every app invitation link you created before converting the app becomes invalid.\n- An universally valid installation link will be generated and displayed on the app details page.\n\nIn order to convert your private app into a public app follow the steps below:\n\n1. Login to the [OTTO Partner Connect](https://portal.otto.market/profile/Dienstleisterprofil) portal.\n2. Navigate to the [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) page.\n3. Click on the three dots (…) right to the app name for which you want to create an invitation link.\n4. In the dropdown menu select \"App Typ zu 'Public' ändern\".\n5. A popup window will be displayed asking you to confirm that you want to convert this app to public.\n6. Done! Your app is now public.\n\n## Scopes\nScopes corresponds to [OAuth scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/). They are used for providing fine-grained access control to the OTTO Market APIs.\n\n### Scopes for OTTO Market APIs\nThe below table gives mapping of displayed scope names in UI to the scope names to be used for fetching token\n\n| Display Name    | Scope Name (To be used in fetching token) |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Installation    | installation                              |\n| PartnerId       | partnerId                                 |\n| Developer       | developer                                 |\n| Products        | products                                  |\n| Orders          | orders                                    |\n| Receipts        | receipts                                  |\n| Returns         | returns                                   |\n| Price Reduction | price-reduction                           |\n| Shipments       | shipments                                 |\n| Quantities      | quantities                                |\n\n### Content declaration of available scopes\n\n#### Installation\nThe installation interface allows a service provider to get the installation details of a Partner\n\n#### PartnerId\nThe partnerId interface allows a service provider, access to the partner's partner id.\n\n#### Developer\nThe developer interface allows a service provider to fetch an installation token\n\n#### Products\n\nThe product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V2).\n\n#### Quantities\n\nOnce the products have been successfully transmitted using the products scope, only the quantities are missing to make the products available to the end customer on otto.de. For this purpose the Quantity Interface allows partners and service providers to update the available quantity for a specific SKU.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Quantities-V2).\n\n#### Orders\n\nThis interface allows partners and service providers to view orders and associated position items. It also allows to send cancellations on order and position item level.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4).\n\n#### Shipments\n\nThis interface should be used to report that shipments have been handed over to the carrier for final delivery to the customer.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1).\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis scope enables the user to manage returns. This includes retrieving a list of announced returns, accepting and declining returns.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2).\n\n#### Receipts\n\nOTTO Market provides receipts to the customers to document financial processes. The scopes enables users to download these documents as a PDF or a JSON.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V2).\n\n#### Price Reduction\n\nThis endpoint enables sellers to apply price reductions to shipped products if the customer is unsatisfied and asks for a partial refund instead of returning the product completely.\n\nRead more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Price-Reductions-V1).\n\n## Sandbox vs Production\nSandbox apps are used to test your API in sandbox environment, when you are approved for sandbox by the OTTO Market team. These apps have\nunrestricted scopes access, so you can create sandbox apps for any scope even if you have not yet been approved of it. For creating and testing with sandbox apps,\nplease see [Access to Sandbox and Creating Sandbox Apps](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Sandbox-and-Creating-Sandbox-Apps).\n\nAs the name states, production apps are for production environment. This can be created after you have an approval from OTTO Market team for the\nproduction environment. Once you have the approval, you can request for public service provider access, to create public apps.\nAn OTTO Market Partner has to provide consent, in order for you to access their\nproduction data. The detailed flow is described in the [Access to Production and Creating Production Apps](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Production-and-Creating-Production-Apps) section below.\n\n\n## Access to Sandbox\nOnce your service provider registration request is approved, you can start using [Sandbox Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/sp-sandbox-apps).\n\n### Creating sandbox test users\nIn [Usermanagement UI](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Nutzerverwaltung) Service Providers can create their own test users for sandbox.\nThis test user can be used for authenticating against sandbox apps\n\nValid email is required for sandbox users. Upon creation of user, a password setting mail will be sent to the given sandbox user emailId\n\n_Note_\n\n- Sandbox users are considered as part of the service provider count itself.\n  You can create a max of 10 users (service providers + sandbox) by default.\n\n\n### Creating sandbox apps\nIn create apps UI, you need to provide the following details,\n- unique name\n- homepage URL\n- authorization callback URL - Refer below section for more info\n- [scopes](docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) - All scopes will be listed in sandbox.\n- app type - Refer [Private and Public Apps](docs#section/Developer-Program/Private-and-Public-Apps) for more info\n\n#### Authorization callback URL\nYou will receive two types of callbacks to this URL:\n1. Test Partner will be redirected to your authorization callback URL after successfully installing your app.\n2. Post successful redirection, you will initiate authorization code flow. Test Partner logs in with their credential. On verifying identity, partner will be redirected to your app's authorization callback URL with auth code.\n\n#### App ID\nA unique app ID which will be used for identifying a service provider app.\nWhen a partner installs this app, this app ID will be used for fetching the installation details.\n\n#### Installation Link\nThis unique, publicly accessible link will be used by OTTO Market partners for installation.\nAn optional parameter \"state\" can be added to the link to preserve the state of application page. If the parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with this parameter.\nYou can simply use this link as a hyperlink into your website.\n\n#### Client ID & Client Secret\nCredentials to be used for authenticating & authorising your app with OTTO authorisation server for\nfetching installation details of partner\n\n## Access to Production\nOnce you are satisfied with everything you have tested in the sandbox, email [OTTO Market](mailto://partnerintegration@otto.market) to get access to Production.\nWhen approved, you can start creating production apps using [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) in OTTO Partner Connect.\nAfter getting production access, the service provider can request for public service provider access via OPC to create public apps\n\n### Creating apps\nIn create apps UI, you need to provide the following details,\n- unique name\n- homepage URL\n- authorization callback URL - Refer below section for more info\n- [scopes](docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) - Only scopes approved for you will be shown\n- app type (only if the service provider has public access)\n\n#### Authorization callback URL\nYou will receive two types of callbacks to this URL:\n1. Partner will be redirected to your authorization callback URL after successfully installing your app.\n2. Post successful redirection, you will initiate authorization code flow. Partner logs in with their credential. On verifying identity, partner will be redirected to your app's authorization callback URL with auth code.\n\n#### App ID\nA unique app ID which will be used for identifying a service provider app.\nWhen a partner installs this app, this app ID will be used for fetching the installation details.\n\n#### Installation Link\nThis unique, publicly accessible link will be used by OTTO Market partners for installation.\nAn optional parameter \"state\" can be added to the link to preserve the state of application page. If the parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with this parameter.\nYou can simply use this link as a hyperlink into your website.\n\n#### Client ID & Client Secret\nCredentials to be used for authenticating & authorising your app with OTTO authorisation server for\nfetching installation details of partner\n\n\n\n## Installation of app by an OTTO Partner (Sandbox | Production)\n<img src=\"/docs/app_installation_flow.jpg\" alt=\"App Installation\"/>\n\n1. The partner navigates to your application's installation link and installs your application. If desired, a \"state\" parameter can be added to the installation link for tracking the installer of your application.\n\n2. After successful installation, the partner is redirected to your application's authorization callback URL. If a \"state\" query parameter was included in the installation link, it will be added to the callback URL, redirecting the user upon successful installation.\n\n3. Within your callback logic, authenticate the partner user and obtain an access token by implementing the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow:\n\n   3.1. Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint with scopes `installation` and `partnerId`. The server should respond with a HTTP 302 response that redirects the user-agent to the authorization URL, which includes parameters like client_id, redirect_uri, response_type, and scope.\n    - Sandbox: https://sandbox.api.otto.market/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope=installation%20partnerId\n    - Production: https://api.otto.market/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope=installation%20partnerId\n\n   Please note that 'REDIRECT_URI' is optional. It serves as the URI where your app can send and receive authentication responses. The protocol, host, and URL path (excluding query parameters) of the 'REDIRECT_URI' must align with your app's authorization callback URL.\n\n   3.2 User logs in and verify their identity\n\n   3.3. After the user grants authorization, your application will receive an authorization code at the redirect URI provided. The server will respond with a HTTP 302 that directs the user-agent to the provided redirect URI.\n\n   3.4. Exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to the token endpoint, including the authorization code, redirect URI, and client ID in the body. Ensure the `Content-Type` header is set as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n- Sandbox: https://sandbox.api.otto.market/oauth2/token\n- Production: https://api.otto.market/oauth2/token\n\nFor more information on implementing the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow, please refer to the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) section of the OAuth2 standard documentation. You can retrieve the necessary endpoints from the OpenID Connect well-known configuration:\n\n- Sandbox Well-Known Endpoint: [Sandbox Well-Known Endpoint](https://sandbox.api.otto.market/sec-api/auth/realms/deepsea-sandbox/.well-known/openid-configuration)\n- Production Well-Known Endpoint: [Production Well-Known Endpoint](https://api.otto.market/sec-api/auth/realms/otto-partner/.well-known/openid-configuration)\n\n4. Upon successful user authentication, retrieve the Installation ID by sending a GET request to the endpoint `/v1/apps/{appId}/installation`. The domain will be sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market based on whether you're in a sandbox or production environment. Replace `{appId}` with your specific service provider application's unique ID. Use the access token obtained in the previous step.\n\n   ```\n   GET /v1/apps/{appId}/installation HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Authorization: Bearer {access_token}\n   ```\n\n   The response will be:\n\n   ```\n   {\n     \"installationId\": \"string\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Implement the Client Credentials Flow to fetch an access token with the `developer` scope:\n\n   ```\n   POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}&scope=developer\n   ```\n\n   Replace `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{CLIENT_SECRET}` with your actual client ID and client secret.\n\n6. With the obtained token, retrieve an installation access token by making a POST request to `/v1/apps/{appId}/installations/{installationId}/accessToken`. The request body should be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and include the `scope` parameter with the values such as `orders`, `shipments`, `receipts`. Please see [Developer Program](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) for list of available scopes. Multiple scope values should be space separated.\n\n   ```\n   POST /v1/apps/{appId}/installations/{installationId}/accessToken HTTP/1.1\n   Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market\n   Authorization: Bearer {access_token}\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   scope={SCOPE_VALUES}\n   ```\n\n   The response will be:\n\n   ```\n   {\n     \"access_token\": \"token\",\n     \"expires_in\": 1800\n   }\n   ```\n\nPlease note that in step 6, the Host header should be either `sandbox.api.otto.market` or `api.otto.market`. Additionally, the Authorization header should include the value `Bearer {access_token}` obtained in step 5.\n\nYou can now use this installation access token to authenticate your requests when accessing OTTO Market APIs. Include the access token in the Authorization header with the value Bearer {access_token} for subsequent API calls.\nPlease note that once the access token expires, repeat steps 5 and 6 to obtain a new access token and installation access token respectively. Use the updated tokens for continued access to OTTO Market APIs.\n"

      "description": "### Product interfaces\nThe product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.\n\nThe API offers endpoints for different aspects of product data management:\n\n- The \"Products\" endpoint can be used to send the products to the OTTO Market. The POST operation will return a state \"PENDING\" and a process id which identifies the processing of the request. This process id is delivered in the response body of the POST request as a collection of links (like \"update-tasks/8a9ab7ec-b1ba-4917-bffa-e1d22f2ebe1b\". These links can be used in a GET operation to look at the results of the processing of the sent product data. You as a partner might send many variations in one request, so the processing could take some time, therefore we only offer an asynchronous access to the received product data. The GET operation of the \"Products\" endpoint can be used after the end of the processing to watch the representation of the product in the exact state sent by you. The state changes to \"DONE\", when the operation is finished and you get an executive summary of the operation. This summary shows the total amount of variations in the process and breaks it down to the amount of variations, which were processed successfully, failed or were send unchanged.\n\n- The \"Product Active Status\" endpoint allows you to pull the products from otto.de, or to put them back to visibility on otto.de. For this you have the POST operation. There is also a GET operation to view the state of products.\n\n- Use the \"Marketplace Status\" endpoint to query the status of the product variations on the OTTO marketplace. If a product variation has been processed without errors, the status includes the link to the product variation on otto.de.\n\n- The \"Brands\" endpoint gives you all the brands OTTO Market knows and can reference. You should use this endpoint to make the brand in your products fit to OTTO Market brand IDs.\n\n- The \"Categories\" endpoint gives you all the assortment categories OTTO Market has defined, so you should use this endpoint to make the category names in your products fit to OTTO Market categories and their exact names.\n\n### Example\nA typical sequence dealing with our interfaces would be:\n```\n1. You query the Brands interface and match the brand names in Your products to the names in the received brands.\n2. You query the Categories interface and match the category names in Your products to the names in the received categories.\n3. You use the POST endpoints from the Products interface to send Your products to Otto Market\n4. You will receive 202 HTTP return code and a body like:\n{\n    \"state\": \"pending\",\n    \"message\": \"The process is currently in progress\",\n    \"progress\": 0,\n    \"total\": 2,\n    \"pingAfter\": \"2020-05-13T10:40:01.815Z\",\n    \"links\": [\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"self\",\n            \"href\": \"/v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"failed\",\n            \"href\": \"/v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b/failed\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"succeeded\",\n            \"href\": \"/v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b/succeeded\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"unchanged\",\n            \"href\": \"/v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b/unchanged\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n5. You execute /v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b until the state changes to \"done\". Usually this will happen very fast.\n6. You execute /v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b/succeeded and /v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b/failed to watch the details of the processing (successfully imported products, and detailed information to failures which occurred in the product data processing).\n7. You may browse /v3/products/update-tasks/09abe6ca-9c36-45bb-9cd3-a7de7f93284b/unchanged to look at the product data which You delivered with the same content as in the former product data delivery.\n```\n\n### Authentication\nAll interfaces expect the consumer to add a valid JWT token to the request, otherwise the request will fail with HTTP 401 or 403\n\n### Rate Limits\nThe OTTO products-API serves billions of API calls every month. The following limits should create the best quality of service for all API users. Every endpoint has its own limits. Too many API calls will cause a HTTP 429 \"too many requests\" error:\n\n| Endpoint path | HTTP method | Max requests per time unit |\n| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| /products | GET | 10 per second |\n| /products | POST | 20 per second |\n| /products/prices | GET | 10 per second |\n| /products/prices | POST | 10 per second |\n| /products/active-status | GET | 10 per second |\n| /products/active-status | POST | 3600 per day |\n| /products/marketplace-status | GET | 10 per second |\n| /products/categories | GET | 10 per second |\n| /products/brands | GET | 10 per second |\n\n#### What to do if you hit the rate limits?\nIf you get responses with a ```429 Too many requests``` status we recommend parsing the ```Retry-After``` header of these responses. Your client then should wait until the specified amount of time has passed before making additional calls, or it may be subject to additional rate limiting.\n\n\n### HTML markup in free texts\nAll fields with free text values (like e.g. description, bullet points, certain category-dependent attributes) do only accept some of\nthe available HTML markup tags - every other markup will be removed,\n\nThe allowed tags are:\n\n* formatting tags</br>\n  ```<b>, <i>, <font>, <s>, <u>, <o>, <sup>, <sub>, <ins>, <del>, <strong>, <strike>, <tt>, <code>, <big>, <small>, <br>, <span>,

2022-09-22 | We are proudly introducing our products API v3 with a lot of changes compared to v2, that we will describe here. Further information for v3 can also be found in the OPC-helpdesk. **v2 will be supported until 31th of March 2023.** After this date, the products interface will reject requests via v2.<br/><br/>**Changed**<br/> - handling brands: We introduce the brandId, which will replace the name of the brand. You can find the brandIds and the matching brand-names at `v3/products/brands`. The new brandId keeps stable, even if the name of a brand will be adjusted in the future. The brandId allows us to seperate between different brands with the same name. The `usable`-tag at every brand gives you the information, if you are allowed to setup products from this brand or you need a special permission for that.<br/> - restrict the length of the attributes `productLine`, `Besondere Merkmale` and `Set-Info` to 70 characters each. The product-title on otto.de is composed based on the selected category. You can find the title-templates in the category-endpoint. These 3 attributes are part of most title-templates. We need to restrict the length to avoid overly long product-titles, which have a bad influence on the customer experience.<br/> - the status of an upload is now more transparent. We now differenciate just between the upload-state \"in progress\" and \"done\". The state \"failed\" isn't shown any more. For your convenience, we also show a more detailed status of the processing, which were included in the upload.<br/> - The asset-links may contain a maximum of 2083 characters.<br/> - Prices should be transmitted with Euro as currency and may contain 2 decimal places. <br/><br/>**Added**<br/> - `deliveryType` offers a new value for goods, which have to be transported to customers by heavy trucks. It is called `FORWARDER_HEAVYDUTY`.<br/> - You can now, if you wish, limit a customer's order in the number of items per order. This can make sense for products where demand is greater than supply. Additionally to the attribute `maxOrderQuantity` known from v2, you can limit the order with a specific period `periodInDays`. A `maxOrderQuantity` with a `quantity` of 5 and a `periodInDays` of 30 means, that a customer can order 5 pieces of this variation in 30 days.<br/><br/> **Removed** <br/> - the attribute `offeringStartDate` is deleted<br/> - `UPC` and `ISBN` are deleted |\n"

      "description": "### Order Interface\n\nThis interface allows partners and service providers to view orders and associated position items. It also allows sending cancellations on order and position item level.\n\nThe term *sales order* refers to a customer's order with items from different partners. The term *partner order* refers to a customer's order containing only the positions of a single partner.<br>\nThis interface is only concerned with partner orders.\n\nA position item is the physical product a customer has ordered. A checkout with a product quantity greater than one will produce unique position items within the partner order.\n\n### Authentication\n\nEvery operation on this interface requires proper credentials. Partners only have visibility on their own orders.\n\n\n### Fulfillment States\n\nA position item can stay in different fulfillment states (attribute 'fulfillmentStatus'):\n\n1. ANNOUNCED -> An ordered position item which shall be reserved for the customer but shall not be shipped yet. The position item can still be cancelled by the marketplace and the customer. The address of the customer is not visible in this state. \n2. PROCESSABLE -> This position item is ready to be fulfilled.\n3. SENT -> This position item was shipped. It was processed by the [Shipments interface](./docs#tag/Shipments-V1).\n4. RETURNED -> This position item was returned. It was processed by the [Returns interface](./docs#tag/Returns-V2).\n5. CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER -> This position item was cancelled by the partner and won't be processed any further.\n6. CANCELLED\\_BY\\_MARKETPLACE -> This position item was cancelled by the marketplace and won't be processed any further. In case of a partner termination all position items in state ANNOUNCED or PROCESSABLE will be cancelled.\n\n### Possible State Transitions\n\n<img src=\"/docs/Overview_fulfillment_status_transitions.svg\" alt=\"Fulfillment status transitions\"/>\n\nThe position item states determine the whole order's lifecycle state:\n\n* The order will be classified as ANNOUNCED, PROCESSABLE, SENT, or RETURNED if at least one position item is in an analogous state **AND** all other position items have the same or higher state according to above-mentioned list.\n* The order will also be classified as CANCELLED\\_BY\\_MARKETPLACE or CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER if it has at least one position item in fulfillment state CANCELLED\\_BY\\_MARKETPLACE resp. CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER.\n\nThe latest lifecycle change is recorded in order attribute 'lifecycleChangeDate'. You can choose to quey by lifecycle state or position item state by using the ```mode```\n\n\n\n### Fetching Orders\n\nOrders can be fetched individually by ```salesOrderId```/ ```orderNumber``` or as a list by using different filter criteria.\n\n#### Common Use Cases\n\n##### Fetch open orders\n\nOrders can be constantly created. After the payment confirmation orders change to state PROCESSABLE. To fetch orders after they became processable this REST call can be used\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=PROCESSABLE\n```\n\nIf there is a next link it can be followed until there are no new orders. To start at a certain date the fromDate can be used, which relates to the lifecycleChangeDate, which in this case is when order became PROCESSABLE. \n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=PROCESSABLE&orderColumnType=ORDER_LIFECYCLE_DATE&fromDate=2023-07-01T00:00:00Z\n```\n\nThis works in a similar way for other status and combinations, for example\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=PROCESSABLE,SENT\n```\n\n##### Fetch all orders for a day\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fromOrderDate=2023-07-01T00:00:00Z&toOrderDate=2023-07-02T00:00:00Z&orderColumnType=ORDER_DATE\n```\n\nThe next link can be followed until there are no orders left. \n\n##### Fetch all orders with returned positions\n\nTo fetch orders with at least one returned position the following query can be used\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders?fulfillmentStatus=RETURNED&mode=AT_LEAST_ONE&orderColumnType=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE&fromDate=2023-07-01T00:00:00Z\n```\n\n##### Fetch a single order\n\nBy ```salesOrderId```\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders/82f3e02f-2f56-448d-8f3b-d42f5a475119\n```\n\nBy ```orderNumber```\n\n```\nGET /v4/orders/v8pnyhq2nh\n```\n\n#### Performance Hints\n\nThere can be a lot of combinations of parameters for the API which will result in varying response times. For best performance results try to use either ```fromDate``` or ```fromOrderDate```/ ```toOrderDate```, not both at the same time. Also orderColumnType works best with ```fromDate``` instead of ```fromOrderDate```/ ```toOrderDate```.\n\n\n#### Pagination\n\nPaging will occur if the number of returned orders exceeds the current limit (request parameter ```limit```).\n\n#### Example\n\n```\n{\n      \"resources\": [\n        { \n          ...\n        }\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"links\": [\n        {\n          \"href\": \"/v4/orders?nextcursor=eyJmZiI6MTY4ODU0Mzk5MDUxMCwicGlmIjoiMTAwNjI1MCIsIm0iOiJCVUNLRVQiLCJvY3QiOiJPUkRFUl9MSUZFQ1lDTEVfREFURSIsIm9kIjoiQVNDIiwic3RmIjoic2FsZXNPcmRlcklkIiwibHNvaSI6ImUxM2IwYTMyLWU1ZTMtNDEwYi05YWQ2LTliZWRlY2MwNzVjNiIsInNvaWNyIjpmYWxzZX0\",\n          \"rel\": \"next\"\n        }\n      ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing  ```/v4/orders?nextcursor=eyJmZiI6MTY4ODU0Mzk5MDUxMCwicGlmIjoiMTAwNjI1MCIsIm0iOiJCVUNLRVQiLCJvY3QiOiJPUkRFUl9MSUZFQ1lDTEVfREFURSIsIm9kIjoiQVNDIiwic3RmIjoic2FsZXNPcmRlcklkIiwibHNvaSI6ImUxM2IwYTMyLWU1ZTMtNDEwYi05YWQ2LTliZWRlY2MwNzVjNiIsInNvaWNyIjpmYWxzZX0``` here would receive the next slice of records; a missing next link indicates no further records.\n\n\n\n\n### Cancellation\n\nPosition items of an order can be cancelled. These position items must be in state PROCESSABLE or ANNOUNCED.<br>\n**Partner cancellations in general lead to customer dissatisfaction and should be avoided.**\n\nCancellation is possible for only a single position item or the whole order:\n\n- to cancel a single position item send a POST request '/v4/orders/{salesOrderId}/positionItems/{positionItemId}/cancellation'\n- to cancel the whole order send a POST request '/v4/orders/{salesOrderId}/cancellation'\n\nEvery position item which is in fulfillment status PROCESSABLE or ANNOUNCED will be changed to CANCELLED\\_BY\\_PARTNER. If there was a cancellation request from the customer the ```cancellationReason``` will be set to CANCELLED_ON_CUSTOMER_WISH\n\nThe cancellation operations might take a moment until the result is visible on a subsequent fetch request.

It would be great if you would also inform us about the condition of the return.\n\nIn the rare case (e.g. if the return does not correspond to the correct article) that you do not want to accept a return, you also have the option to reject the return. In this case we would like to receive a reason in addition to the condition of the return.\n\nReject reason is a free text where you can tell us why you are rejecting the return. This will help us understand and if possible, reduce \"bad\" returns.   \nSome examples of return reasons could be \"Not my product\", \"Returned later than is allowed to\", \"Possible fraud\", \"Non-returnable item\" etc.\"\n\nWe expect the following values for the condition:\n\t\n* A for \"in original packaging\" \n* B for \"in mint condition\"\n* C for \"slightly used\"\n* D for \"heavily used\"\n* E for \"mistake (Delivery incomplete, not available,...)\"\n\nIf you have already accepted a return, it cannot be rejected again afterwards. However, if you feel you have changed your mind about a rejected return, you still have the option to accept the return afterwards.\n\n\n### Changelog\n\nThis changelog will document all relevant changes in our interface.<br/>\nKudos to https://keepachangelog.com/de/1.0.0/\n\n\n| Date | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| 2023-04-11 | **Updated** <br/> - Updated 500 error content for /v2/returns api.|\n| 2023-04-11 | **Updated** <br/> - Updated 500 error document for /v2/returns api.|\n| 2021-05-10 | **Updated** <br/> - Updated positionItemId examples for /v2/returns api.|\n| 2021-04-30 | **Updated** <br/> - Updated examples for /v2/returns api.| \n| 2021-02-04 | **Updated** <br/> - Updated get api /v2/returns limit description.| \n| 2020-05-05 | **Updated** <br/> - Updated Rejected Returns Api Description.| \n| 2020-04-13 | **Added** <br/> - validation to post api /v2/returns to check if the salesOrderId is valid.|\n| 2020-02-17 | **Added** <br/> - get api /v2/returns to view returns accepted and return rejected by customer.|\n| 2019-10-25 | **Added** <br/> - get api /v2/returns to view returns announced by customer and misdirected at otto warehouse.|\n| 2019-10-25 | **Updated** <br/>  - Updated allowed enum values for /v2/returns status parameter <br/> - Changed GET /v2/returns status parameter from required to optional <br/> - Updated 200 response example for /v2/returns |\n"

      "description": "### Receipts Interface\n\nUsing this API, partners and/or their service provider can get all receipts generated in their name in context of B2C\nprocesses to document the billing process on OTTO Market.\n\n<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 18px;\">⚠</span>  **Please for your own interest, hand over all receipt types you are interested in using the new list parameter receiptTypes, so that OTTO Market could add new receipt types without side effects for your own processes.**</br>\n**Using this option you can decide by your own when to incorporate new receipt types in your own processes.**</br>\n**Please do not use the possibility of calls without specifying the receiptTypes anymore.**\n\nAll receipt types currently exists in live environment:\n\n- **PURCHASE** </br>\n  A purchase receipt (also called an invoice) documents what prices charged by the customer at the time of sales, taking\n  into account granted discounts.\n  The receipt contains information per order, partner and shipment. It is created when items are shipped to the\n  customer. Each item or service is invoiced exactly once. So that there can be more than one receipt per order.\n  Shipping costs are charged only once per partner and order and are shown only once in case of partial shipments of an\n  order.\n  Surcharges levied by a payment provider on the customer when using special payment conditions are not part of the\n  receipts of OTTO Market.\n- **REFUND**</br>\n  We distinguish different types of reimbursement documents. A refund receipt documents the a customer's claim of\n  reimbursement.\n  This receipt is currently created when returned items are accepted. A refund receipt normally contains at least an\n  item or service. In very rare cases, however, refund receipts can also be created in context of the cancellation\n  process to repay shipping costs only billed for full returns.\n  Earlier partial refunds are taken into account.\n- **PARTIAL_REFUND** </br>\n  We distinguish different types of reimbursement documents. A partial refund receipt documents a customer's claim of\n  reimbursement.\n  Different reasons are possible for partner to trigger such a receipt. For example a partial refund of an item price as\n  a gesture of goodwill to avoid returns\n\nOn all documents you will usually find\n\n- item/service details\n- shipped quantities\n- delivery costs\n- payment details\n- customer details\n- partner details\n\nSome details can only be found on the pdf documents. These include for example:\n\n- Company logo of OTTO (as operator of OTTO Market)\n- Company details of financial service providers\n- Contact details of OTTO (as relation center operator for customer inquiries and complaints)\n\nGeneral information:\n\n- Pdf documents are only generated once and do not change over time.\n- When a pdf is generated, dates are printed on the pdf documents in format DD.MM.YYYY in time zone (CET/CEST) from\n  Germany.\n- Currently, we provide receipts that are up to 4 years old. We could not guarantee this forever, so it would be good,\n  if you plan to get receipts always periodically.\n\nBelow you find the end points which can use to retrieve this information from the Receipts API.\n\n### Interested in some more details?\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Rough class diagram of JSON representation of receipt (Click to Expand)</b></mark>\n</summary>\n<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 18px;\">⚠</span>  This class diagram only shows the main objects to show the general structure.
